{"FoxNews.com": ["advertisement \nQanta Shimizu was leaving a Chase Bank in Manhattan's Chinatown last week , the day of the presidential debate, when he was approached by a television interviewer with a microphone. \"He just needs to understand, respect the culture. ... Don't taint the beautifulness of this country with your [disrespect].\" \n\"As a Chinese, what do you think about Donald Trump,\" asked Fox News correspondent Jesse Watters, according to Shimizu. \n\"I said, 'No, I'm Japanese, I don't think I'm qualified to answer that question,'\" Shimizu, who recalled his encounter during an interview with NBC News Thursday afternoon, said. \nShimizu said he was never asked a follow-up about how he, as a Japanese person, viewed Trump. But a question on karate was slipped in by Watters, who does on-street interviews for a segment called \"Watters' World,\" which airs on Fox News' \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" \nFortunately for Shimizu, he'd been studying the martial art with a Ukrainian karate master, he said. \n\"[Watters] asked me to punch, and that was taken in the picture,\" Shimizu said, adding that he wasn't happy with the resulting video, which opened with the song \"Kung Fu Fighting.\" Qanta Shimizu (right) was featured in a Fox News segment, Monday, Oct. 3, 2016, with correspondent Jesse Watters that many are criticizing for being offensive. \nRELATED: Civil Rights Groups Criticize Fox News for 'Racist and Offensive' Chinatown Segment \nShimizu was one of a number of Asian Americans who found themselves featured on the \"Chinatown Edition\" of \"Watters' World,\" a segment that has sparked outrage this week among people throughout the country, including members of civil rights organizations and elected officials. \nWhile the segment was billed as an attempt to understand the political views of people in Chinatown, what emerged, critics say, was a roughly three-and-a-half minute video montage that perpetuated entrenched stereotypes of Chinese and Asian Americans. Qanta Shimizu, who was featured in a Fox News segment set in Chinatown about Chinese-American voters that many have called \"offensive,\" told NBC News he tried to tell the correspondent he is Japanese, not Chinese. Traci Lee / NBC News \nReaction to the segment was swift from state and federally elected officials, including New York State Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens) and U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY). Along with several dozen community members, Kim and Meng participated in a news conference Thursday afternoon outside Fox News headquarters in Manhattan, criticizing the news organization for broadcasting the video. \n\"This segment definitely crossed the line,\" Meng said. \"It was in bad taste and a very poor attempt at humor.\" \nKim used the words \"offensive\" and \"racist\" to describe the segment. U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) speaks Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, during a press conference outside of Fox, News Corp.'s headquarters in midtown Manhattan. Charles Lam / NBC News \n\"We are calling on Fox News to issue an official apology and completely retract this clip,\" Kim said. \"We are also prepared to take this fight to the next level by calling for public boycotts of all corporations who sponsor this show until they comply with our community's demands.\" \nThursday night on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show,\" comedian Ronny Chieng delivered a profanity-laced message directed at Watters that included Chieng going to Manhattan's Chinatown to speak seriously with Asian Americans about politics. \nIn response to the backlash, Watters tweeted earlier this week that \"my man-on-the-street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense.\" He added in a second message that \"as a political humorist, the Chinatown segment was intended to be a light piece, as all Watters World segments are.\" My man-on-the-street interviews are meant to be taken as tongue-in-cheek and I regret if anyone found offense. \u2014 Jesse Watters (@jessebwatters) October 5, 2016 \nAccording to the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA), \"The O'Reilly Factor\" invited AAJA president Paul Cheung to appear on its Friday show \u2014 but Cheung declined. Instead, AAJA countered by inviting Watters, his producers, and Fox News staff to attend a town hall at the Museum of Chinese in America in Chinatown, scheduled for Sunday afternoon. \n\"We appreciate the invitation to educate Bill O'Reilly and his audience on the offensive nature of the 'Watters' World' segment,\" AAJA wrote on its webpage . \"However, we believe meaningful engagement can occur only if there is significant dialogue not just with us, but with the broader community.\" \nIt wasn't immediately clear if Fox News would issue an apology or plans to attend the town hall.

They named immigration, healthcare, job creation, and foreign policy as some of the key issues in this election season. All of them are topics of importance raised by respondents in a survey of Asian-American registered voters released on Wednesday. \nWhile most said they were ineligible to cast ballots this November \u2014 many explained that they were green-card holders or not citizens \u2014 their responses offered an alternative narrative to the one depicted in the \"Watters' World\" segment, which was roundly denounced for filming an elderly Chinese woman and man unable to answer questions on the candidates in English, presumably because of a language barrier.

Trump, on the one hand, comes off as a \"spoiled brat\" with a \"big mouth,\" Huang said. Clinton, on the other, is not \"amazing,\" but \"at least she has a team,\" he said. \n\"Her husband used to be president,\" added Huang. \"If something really goes wrong, I think Bill Clinton maybe can give her some advice.\" \nHuang continued, \"I think she has leadership. I like someone more calm. Trump is way too much.\" \"This segment definitely crossed the line. It was in bad taste and a very poor attempt at humor.\" \nPeixian Jiang, a 20-year-old working at a bakery, said in Mandarin that she wouldn't vote for either candidate. She called Clinton's rhetoric \"sharp\" at times, and said the former secretary of state's viewpoints can come across as \"too extreme,\" though she didn't offer specific examples. \nA few doors down at AE Company, which sells Chinese herbs, customer Hai Li also said he likes neither Trump nor Clinton. He said he feels Trump attacks all types of people, regardless of race or ethnicity. Asked whom he would vote for if he could, Li replied in Mandarin, \"There is no good choice.\" \nBut Yan Chen, a middle-aged woman behind the counter, quickly added in that she would cast a ballot for Trump. \n\"I like his policies on education, immigration, and the economy,\" Chen said in Mandarin, without getting into specifics. \nRELATED: Clinton Holds 41-Point Lead Over Trump Among Asian-American Voters: Survey \nThe Fall 2016 National Asian American Survey , conducted between Aug. 10 and Sept. 29 in 11 different languages, found that 14 percent of Asian-American registered voters intended to vote for Trump, compared to 55 percent for Clinton. Some 16 percent were still undecided, according to the survey. \nFor Chinese, in particular, 53 percent said they were behind Clinton, while 12 percent backed Trump, the survey reported. One in five didn't know or refused to answer. \nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders account for roughly five percent of eligible voters and six percent of the United States resident population, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, the director of the survey and a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside. Courtesy of the National Asian American Survey \nFor those in Chinatown who spoke with NBC News, immigration was among the topics they said they were paying attention to this election season. Wei Lun Wong, a 20-year-old from Malaysia working at an ice cream shop in Manhattan's Lower East Side, said he believes in legal immigration and said he appreciated Trump's overall experience. \nAsked if he liked the real-estate mogul's attitude, however, he responded with a simple, \"No.\" \nWhile Wong acknowledged that he prefers Trump, he also said he worries he could be sent back to his native Malaysia if the billionaire becomes president. \n\"That's the irony,\" he said, laughing. \nRELATED: Immigration, Diversity Front and Center at 'Quad-Partisan' Presidential Election Forum \nFor Shimizu, the Japanese man who appeared on Watters' World, healthcare remains a serious issue, he said. He added that he's a Clinton supporter and wants to prevent a Trump presidency. \n\"Health insurance is horrible in this country compared with my country,\" said Shimizu, the founder and chief technology officer of a design firm with an office in Chinatown. \nWhen asked about the \"Watters' World\" segment, Asian Americans in Chinatown expressed mixed reaction over how the clip came across to them. \nChen, the AE Company employee, said simply that \"it wasn't fair,\" adding it \"discriminated against Chinese.\" Li, the customer, pointed out that freedom of speech exists in the U.S. \"However, we believe meaningful engagement can occur only if there is significant dialogue not just with us, but with the broader community.\" \nBut for Shimizu, who said he didn't know beforehand how his interview with Watters would be used, the segment was offensive and \"was more horrible than I thought,\" he said. \nHaving lived in New York City for three years, Shimizu said he's comfortable working in the Big Apple and enjoys its diversity, even though sometimes he has struggled to survive and has encountered some bad experiences. \nAsked what he would say to Watters if given the chance, Shimizu said, \"I [would] talk about, what is culture? ... He just needs to understand, respect the culture. ...

Israel\u2019s Bibi Netanyahu wanted no part of him and neither did the Scottish Parliament, while Ireland\u2019s Enda Kenny announced he would only meet with Trump to \u201ctell him he\u2019s a racist.\u201d\nSo along comes Mexico\u2019s President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who also happens to be the third most despised entity South of the Border behind only Trump and lice (yes, in that order), to throw the Republican presidential nominee\u2019s floundering campaign a lifeline.\nNeedless to say, it was not a popular move by Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \nIn fact, with this one very public act of kissing Trump\u2019s behind, he forever cements his image in the minds of the Mexican people as President \u201cPendejo\u201d Nieto. He worshiped at the foot of the man who called his people \u201crapists.\u201d \nPe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s image, horribly tarnished by charges of corruption against both him and his wife and by his ham-handed attempt to brush the disappearance of 43 students under Mexico's carpet, is now even more damaged and may have just guaranteed a win by the conservative National Action Party (PAN) in the next presidential election.\nMeanwhile, Trump seems to have gained, if nothing else at least a great photo op in whichin that one brief moment he seemed almost presidential. But then he went and blew it by running back to his base at a rally in Arizona where people were actually holding up Hillary Clinton\u2019s bloody head on a stick (not kidding, look at the video) and screaming for more than an hour. Trump\u2019s message was as simple as it was wrong: Undocumented immigrants are bad and dangerous and I will get rid of them all. Nice!\nThe problem for Donald Trump is exactly what a TV executive once warned me about when I kept insisting on booking an easily excitable guest \u2014 \u201cHe scares people.\u201d \nThis is bad, real bad for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. Not because it\u2019s going to affect his base, the ones we saw last night at his Arizona rally. They\u2019re locked in. \nThe voters he is scaring off are the very people who were willing to give him a chance. These voters aren\u2019t Latinos or African-Americans, they\u2019re long gone. nor are they Muslim, Asian or young. Trump has no chance with them either.\nThe one voting block Trump could possibly grow or at least maintain is made up of disaffected white, non-Asian, non-Latinos. These potential Trump voters would have been more than willing to support the GOP candidate as they have in the past. Many if not most of them chose John McCain and Mitt Romney over Barack Obama. They voted for Bill Clinton, but then turned around and voted for George W. Bush. \nYou could argue these are the voters who truly moderate our elections. Could I go as far as to suggest they keep us sane? \nNo, then let\u2019s call what is going on right now white flight . \nThe so-called moderate or undecided white voters appear to be abandoning Trump by record numbers in states that have been unheard of for Republicans to lose in past elections \u2014 places like Georgia, Iowa, Missouri and Arizona, where Trump and Clinton are tied, and in places like Texas, Indiana and South Carolina where Clinton is within striking distance. \nLet me say that again, the Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United States is within a 4 to 8-point margin of winning in Texas, South Carolina and Indiana. \nIf present trends continue, what we\u2019re witnessing is historic \u2014 a true game changer.\nThe election of Donald Trump, which once seemed improbable, is now looking downright impossible. In fact, the only thing that could make it worse, make it a complete blowout, would be for Trump to lose the support of his base. Then we would be looking at a landslide. \nThat could never happen, right? \nNo, because the only thing that could bring that about is a major Trump shift on his core positions. For example, Trump\u2019s raison d'\u00eatre \u2014 his reason for being, his essence \u2014 is immigration. He has based his entire campaign on \u201ckicking out the illegals\u201d faster than \u201cour heads can spin\u201d on \u201cDay 1 of his presidency.\u201d\nDevoted Trumpsters love that kind of talk. It\u2019s their sweet spot, the sugar in their Southern sweet tea, the baloney in their sandwich and the gravy on their meatloaf. You can\u2019t have one without the other. There is no Trump base without a Trump message about kicking out \u201cthe illegals.\u201d\nAnd that is why last night Trump had to undo whatever goodwill President \u201cPendejo\u201d Nieto may have bestowed on him. \n\nRick Sanchez is a contributor for Fox News Latino. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Published September 05, 2016 EFE Washington \u2013   Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on Monday rejected the invitation to visit Mexico extended by that country's president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, an invitation he had also extended to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who accepted.\nIn an interview with ABC, journalist David Muir asked the former secretary of state if she planned to accept Pe\u00f1a Nieto's invitation and travel to the U.S. southern neighbor before the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\"No,\" answered Clinton, who said that the intended to focus on policies to create jobs in the United States and to do what she must \"to create jobs here at home, ... to make sure Americans have the best possible opportunities in the future.\"\nTrump met last Wednesday in Mexico with Pe\u00f1a Nieto and hours later delivered a campaign speech in Arizona in which he reiterated his hard line against immigration and insisted that he will build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep illegal migrants out, get Mexico to pay for the barrier and deport all undocumented foreigners.\nIn Mexico City, at a joint press conference, Trump had said he has great respect for Mexican-Americans.\nIn her most definitive statement on the matter so far, Clinton told ABC that she felt Trump had created a \"diplomatic incident\" with his Mexican trip.\n\"He came out saying one thing and the Mexican president contradicted him almost immediately,\" said Clinton, referring to Trump's assertion that payment for the border wall was not discussed with Pe\u00f1a Nieto.\n\"He didn't know how to even communicate effectively with a head of state.

And they have done it in ways as varied as working with refugees, studying the forces that led to the attacks and pursuing a parent's unrealized pro-sports dream. \nHere are some of their stories. \n__ \n\"THINGS KIND OF COME FULL CIRCLE\" \nIt's Lindsay Weinberg's job to find and notify families whose loved ones have died, sometimes under violent circumstances. It's a job she's particularly prepared to do. \n\"I'm giving them among the worst news they can receive, and I've received it,\" she says. \nWeinberg was 12 when the New York City medical examiner's office, where she now works, told her family in 2002 that it had identified her father's remains among the victims of 9/11. \n\"It adds to the amount of empathy that I can have,\" says the 26-year-old, whose father, Steven Weinberg, was an accounting manager killed at the World Trade Center. \nAfter recognizing how forensic science helped provide answers for her family, Lindsay got a master's degree in it, and is now an outreach investigator. She hasn't worked on the continuing analysis of the more than 21,000 bits of bone found at ground zero. \nShe says her connection to 9/11 is \"not something that I lead with, personally or professionally.\" But working at the medical examiner's office, she says, shows \"how things kind of come full circle.\" \n___ \n\"I THOUGHT, 'WHAT WAS IT WE SHARED THE MOST?' AND IT WAS WRESTLING\" \nThea Trinidad's pulse thumped as she walked out on the floor of Madison Square Garden as part of pro wrestler Adam Rose's entourage in 2014. It was the first time she'd been there in her own wrestling career. And the first time since she'd been there with her dad. \nLooking up at the seats where they always sat \"was like a punch to the heart,\" she says. \nShe was 10 when she overheard her father calling her mother to say goodbye from the trade center's north tower, where he worked as a telecommunications analyst. Growing up, she pondered how to honor him. \n\"I thought: 'What was it we shared the most?' And it was wrestling,\" she recalls. \nMichael Trinidad was a former high school wrestler who didn't flinch when his tomboy daughter did leaping moves off the furniture. In fact, \"he'd say, 'No, you're doing it wrong \u2014 let me show you,'\" says Thea, 25, who lives in Tampa, Florida. \nAt first, the 5-foot-tall wrestler didn't let on about her dad as she backflipped and body-slammed under the monikers Divina Fly and Rosita. (She now uses her own name). She didn't want anyone thinking she was making a play for sympathy. \nAfter her story emerged, Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine named her Inspirational Wrestler of the Year in 2011. \nShe says she feels her father's spirit every time she goes into the ring. \n\"This one's for you, Dad,\" she tells herself. \"Protect me out there.\" \n___ \n\"POSITIVE, PERSONAL GROWTH OUT OF SOMETHING THAT WAS SO HORRIFIC\" \nSeveral years after 9/11, Michael Massaroli came across a plastic bin filled with condolence messages. \nThey had come from people around the country and world, many of them strangers, after the attacks killed his father and namesake, an investment executive. Michael was 6. His widowed mother had just given birth to a baby girl two months earlier. \n\"Hearing how people were so selfless and so caring to us really made me want to try to do something, career-wise, that I thought would help other people,\" he says. \nHe decided that would be public service, since he was already interested in politics. By high school, he was interning for a state assemblyman. \nNow 21 and newly graduated from George Washington University, he got his first job working at a Washington firm that helps political campaigns handle their finances properly. He sees himself eventually working in government as an adviser or aide. \n\"I really try and at least get positive personal growth out of something that was so horrific,\" he says, \"rather than let it break me down.\" \n___ \n\"THE LOVE AND THE HERITAGE COMES THROUGH\" \nAnjunelly Jean-Pierre once had her future all figured out. She planned on joining the military and eventually becoming the doctor or lawyer her mother envisioned. \nThen her mother, Maxima Jean-Pierre, was killed at the World Trade Center, where the immigrant from the Dominican Republic managed an executive cafe. \nOver the next few years, Anjunelly grieved, regrouped and decided she wanted to do what her mother did. Recalling the Sunday dinners that filled the house with friends and family, \"I saw how food brings people together,\" says Anjunelly, 34. \nAfter culinary school and a stint as a sous-chef for an Emeril Lagasse TV show, Anjunelly now works in a setting where bringing people together is perhaps especially important: She is a manager in the Members' Dining Room in Congress. \nLast September, a letter she wrote about Maxima was entered into the Congressional Record.

But 9/11 made her want \"to be that person to decipher that information, to protect the homeland.\" \nNow 28, she works on a cybersecurity project for a contractor for the federal General Services Administration in Washington. \nStudying for her career \u2014 with help from the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, set up for the children of 9/11 victims \u2014 also meant dealing with the frustration of contemplating missed opportunities to disrupt the terror plot. \nWhen the anger stirred, she'd think of some advice her father gave her a few weeks before the attacks. \n\"You can't look back with regret,\" he told her. And \"never say, 'What if?'\" \n___ \n\"ONCE IT'S ON MY SKIN, I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT\" \nIt's all right to ask Ryan McGowan about the \"IX.XI\" tattooed on the back of her neck. It's 9/11 in Roman numerals. \n\"Once it's on my skin,\" she says, \"I have to talk about it.\" \nRyan was 5, sister Casey 4, when their mother, investment executive Stacey Sennas McGowan, was killed at the trade center. \nAs a preteen, Ryan partly played the role of parent, helping her sister pick outfits for school and making dinner when their father, Tom, had to work. She came to think of her mother as \"an amazing guardian angel.\" \nNow 20, Ryan is a junior majoring in marketing at Boston College, where 19-year-old Casey is a sophomore in communications. \nOften, Ryan makes her way through the campus to a labyrinth inscribed with her mom's name and those of 21 fellow BC graduates killed in 9/11.

Jacqueline Milam, was pregnant with him on 9/11. She safely escaped from the Pentagon. \nRonald Jr., now a 14-year-old high school freshman in San Antonio, is one of the more than 100 Sept. 11 victims' children who were born after the attacks. \nHe has his dad's features and unflappable personality.

Sonia was 7. \nHis death fueled Sonia's impulse to try to help where others turn away. \n\"Because I had faced loss at such a young age and in such a different way than many other people, I recognized hardship in other people's life a lot more easily,\" says the 22-year-old senior, who took a year off from college for religious study.

", "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Sept. 6, 2016: Migrants walk in the northern area of the camp called the \"Jungle\" in Calais, France. (Reuters) \nIn what could be a \"told you so\" moment for Donald Trump, the U.K. on Tuesday announced plans to build a \"big new wall\" at a border port in France to prevent migrants from nearby camps sneaking aboard vehicles heading to Britain. \nRobert Goodwill, minister of state for immigration, announced the plan for a wall in Calais, France, at a Home Affairs Committee hearing Tuesday, saying it would be in addition to an already existing fence. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start building this big new wall very soon,\u201d Goodwill said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the fence, now we\u2019re doing a wall.\u201d \nThe proposal is far smaller in scope than the kind of U.S.-Mexico wall Trump is demanding. \nA Home Office spokeswoman told FoxNews.com the four-meter-high wall (about 13 feet) would be built along both sides of a one-kilometer (.6 mile) stretch of the main road into the Calais port. The office estimates it will be done by the end of the year. \nCalais is a common point for migrants trying to enter the U.K. illegally. It is the narrowest point of the English Channel and has the most ferry crossings to England as well as being an access point to the Eurotunnel \u2013 the rail system that goes underneath the channel. The wall is intended to protect the road from migrants who frequently try to intercept vehicles approaching the port and jump on board. \nThough the wall is significantly smaller than what Trump has proposed \u2013 and would protect a road rather than an entire border -- it weaves into Trump\u2019s narrative that walls work and are a vital part of a comprehensive immigration policy. \nProponents of Trump\u2019s plan have noted the success of other countries in building a border wall. The most commonly cited example is Israel, which built a wall along the West Bank that it says has been effective in reducing the threat of terrorism. Trump has cited Israel\u2019s wall as justification for his own plan. \n\"You ask Israel whether or not a wall works,\" Trump told a New Hampshire crowd last year. \nThe migrant crisis in Calais has been a frequent issue of tension between the U.K. and France, with many in the U.K. concerned the French do not do enough to keep migrants from passing through. \nIn 2003, France, Belgium and the U.K. established \u201cjuxtaposed controls\u201d \u2013 an arrangement by which British officials conduct immigration checks before passengers board the train or ferry from Calais, to prevent illegal immigrants from being able to lodge an asylum application on arrival in the U.K. Some French politicians have called for the arrangement to be undone. \nThe British government, meanwhile, has been pushing for stronger controls in Calais. A Home Office Committee report said the U.K. and French had invested in \u201cadditional fencing and floodlighting, CCTV, and infra-red detection technology.\u201d \nHowever, the report said the situation remained a \u201cthreat to UK security,\u201d and noted the most common nationalities of migrants at Calais are Syrian, Eritrean, Sudanese, Iranian and Iraqi. It also found that between 5,000 and 7,000 migrants live in camps surrounding the area. \nBob Dane, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform -- which advocates for stricter immigration controls -- welcomed the U.K. move but warned that more needs to be done. \n\u201cBorder fences are not only visible, physical symbols that proclaim a country\u2019s sovereignty and right to maintain a rule of law, but they also slow the flow of unauthorized entry. That said, Britain, just like the United States, must understand that unless the incentives for illegal entry are eliminated, border barriers will be breached,\u201d Dane told FoxNews.com \nDane said Trump's immigration plan could offer guidance for Europe. \u201cIn his speech the other night, Trump moved beyond just building the fence and addressed the broader push-and-pull factors. Britain, and really all of Europe, will need to similarly take this holistic approach if it ever intends to mitigate the impact of mass migration,\u201d he said. \nThe wall comes as new Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May sets her sights on cracking down on immigration in light of the British vote to leave the European Union in June. Goodwill told the committee the government wants to reduce immigration to \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people \u201cas soon as we possibly can.\u201d \nTrump's wall plan remains controversial. A CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday found only 41 percent of voters back a wall across the southern border. \nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, is also thought to be responsible for bombs discovered in New Jersey. \nThe incident puts real pressure on Obama to make the case for taking in thousands of additional refugees, in the face of calls from Donald Trump and other Republican critics who say it's time to tighten the rules, not ease them. Obama's critics say the timing couldn't be worse. \n\"The timing of the summit just reinforces the idea that we need to get a handle on our refugee program,\" Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, told the Washington Examiner. \"There is a clear and present danger posed to our national security by these poorly vetted refugees that are pouring in, and the president continues to double down on his intentions to bring in more and more of the individuals from hot spots like Syria.\" ", "Ask yourself this question, if you were an alien civilization would you make contact with us?

That's according to a spokesman, Jesse Lehrich. \nHe said Friday that Clinton continues to support efforts to \"hold accountable those responsible\" for the attacks. \nObama is expected to veto the bill later Friday. He says it would undermine already-strained diplomatic relations with a critical U.S. ally. \nCongressional leaders say they have the voters to override Obama's veto. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nIn the final sprint to Election Day, Donald Trump faces a daunting series of roadblocks in the minds of Americans as he tries to catch up to Hillary Clinton. \nThat's according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll that finds that more than half the country fears a Trump presidency. Only about third of Americans believe he is at least somewhat qualified to serve in the White House. \nMoreover, most voters oppose the hard-line approach to immigration that is the centerpiece of the billionaire businessman's campaign. \nWhile Trump undoubtedly has a passionate base of supporters, most voters don't share their fervor. Only 29 percent of registered voters would be excited and just 24 percent would be proud should Trump prevail in November. \n___ \n12 p.m. \nDemocratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine is highlighting some of Donald Trump's provocative statements about women, the same day Hillary Clinton's campaign released television ads doing the same. \nSpeaking at a rally at a union hall in Houston, Kaine said Trump has a troubling history of calling women \"fat pigs\" and \"dogs.\" \nThe Clinton campaign's new ad shows girls and women looking in the mirror as audio plays of Trump making insulting comments about women. \nKaine also criticized Trump's campaign for selling buttons on its website that say \"Hillary for prison.\" Kaine said Trump's history of name-calling will likely be on display during Monday's first presidential debate. \nKaine said: \"They name-call her because that's all they got folks.\" \n___ \n11:50 a.m. \nTim Kaine is warning those considering voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson as a form of protest that their decision could have \"deeply troubling\" consequences. \nThe Democratic vice presidential candidate says votes for third-party candidates have been costly. Kaine said if Ralph Nader hadn't pulled away votes from Al Gore in the 2000 election, then the U.S. \"probably wouldn't have had a war in Iraq.\" He spoke in an interview with Katie Couric for Yahoo News posted online Friday. \nKaine said \"everybody knows\" that Johnson won't win, but supporting him could help Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. \nKaine said that \"casting a vote, a protest vote for a third-party candidate that's going to lose may well affect the outcome, and may well lead to a consequence that is deeply, deeply troubling.\" \n___ \n11:45 a.m. \nBruce Springsteen says Donald Trump's presidential campaign is a \"great embarrassment\" for Americans. \nThe Boss shared his thoughts on the Republican candidate as a guest on Swedish-Norwegian talk show \"Skavlan.\" \nIn an excerpt of the program posted online by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Friday, Springsteen said he understands why people who have struggled to make ends meet could find some of Trump's arguments compelling. \nCommenting on Trump's chances, he said \"the absurdity is beyond cartoon-like. But he's gotten close enough so it can make you nervous. I don't think he's going to win, but even him running is a great embarrassment if you're an American.\" \nHosted by Norwegian TV personality Fredrik Skavlan, the talk show is produced jointly for public service broadcasters SVT of Sweden and NRK of Norway. \n___ \n11:35 a.m. \nDonald Trump has added 10 names to the list of people he says he'll choose from to fill Supreme Court vacancies. \nAmong the names on the list to be released Friday: Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who notably has yet to endorse the Republican nominee. \nThe list adds several minority judges to Trump's list. Nine of the 10 new names are men. The list was first reported by NBC. \nTrump in May unveiled a list of 11 federal and state court judges as potential replacements for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \nTrump has wavered in the language he's used to describe the list. At times, he's said he would pick directly from it. At others, he's said the people he would nominate would share similar qualities to those on the list. \n___ \n7:30 a.m. \nPresident Barack Obama says it would good for Donald Trump to visit the Smithsonian Institution's new National Museum of African American History and Culture that is opening this weekend. \nObama was disputing the Republican presidential candidate's assertion that \"African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they have ever been in before.\" \nIn an interview broadcast Friday on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Obama said: \"I think even most 8-year-olds would tell you that whole slavery thing wasn't very good for black people. Jim Crow wasn't very good for black people.\" \nWhen asked what advice he would give Hillary Clinton ahead of Monday's debate with Trump, Obama said she should be herself and explain what motivates her. \nHe said: \"She's in this for the right reasons.\" \n___ \n6:00 a.m. \nHillary Clinton's campaign is releasing a new television ad that rehashes some of Donald Trump's most provocative statements about women in the past. \nThe 30-second ad shows young girls and women looking in the mirror as they hear Trump describe various women as \"fat,\" a \"slob\" and one who \"ate like a pig.\" \nIt ends with the tag line: \"Is this the president we want for our daughters?\" It's the latest attempt by her campaign to use Trump's words against him and is similar to ads aimed at voters in battleground states, including veterans and people with disabilities. \nClinton's campaign plans to run the ad in Ohio, New Hampshire, Iowa, Florida, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and on national cable. \n3:30 a.m. \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is seeking to show law-and-order toughness along with empathy for African-Americans as he criticizes violent protests stemming from another fatal police shooting of a black man. \nHis Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, was behind closed doors as she prepared for their initial debate and did not address on Thursday the escalating racial tensions in Charlotte, North Carolina. The city was under a midnight curfew after two previous nights of chaotic protests that led to one death as well as injuries, arrests and vandalism. \nTrump has spent the last several weeks asking black Americans for their support and asserting that President Barack Obama has failed the black community, but those appeals have been undermined at times.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) 2016 Getty Images \nTwo vastly different visions of what's the United States' future should look like will be laid out in stark contrast as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump confront each other face-to-face for the first time in Monday night's presidential debate at Hofstra University. \nThe high-stakes showdown \u2014 the first of three presidential debates \u2014 comes as both candidates are viewed negatively by large numbers of Americans, with Democrat Clinton facing questions about her trustworthiness and Republican Trump struggling to convince many voters that he has the temperament and policy depth to be president. \nInterest in the presidential race has been intense, and the campaigns are expecting a record-breaking audience to watch the 90-minute televised debate at suburban New York's Hofstra University. \nClinton, a former senator and secretary of state, is banking on voters seeing her as a steady hand who can build on the record of President Barack Obama, whose popularity is rising as he winds down his second term in office. She's called for expanding Obama's executive orders if Congress won't pass legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system and for broader gun control measures. Overseas, she's called for a no-fly zone in Syria but has vowed to keep the military out of a large-scale ground war to defeat the Islamic State group. \nFor Clinton, victory in November largely hinges on rallying the same young and diverse coalition that elected Obama but has yet to fully embrace her. \n\"Hillary has recognized that she has a lot of work to do to earn people's trust,\" said Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager. \"We think this debate is a fantastic opportunity for her to present not just what she is going to do to make a difference in people's lives, but she actually has a long history of getting this done.\" \nTrump has tapped into deep anxieties among some Americans, particularly white, working-class voters who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying nation. While the real estate mogul lacks the experience Americans have traditionally sought in a commander in chief, he's banking on frustration with career politicians and disdain for Clinton to push him over the top on Election Day. \n\"He speaks a language that people out there can understand, and so I think that he's going to have a good night,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said of Trump's debate prospects. \nThe centerpiece of Trump's campaign has been a push for restrictive immigration measures, including a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and an early proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from coming to the U.S. But he's been less detailed about other ideas, including his plan for stamping out the Islamic State group in the Middle East. \nClinton's camp is worried that Trump will be held to a different standard in the debate and is particularly concerned that the notoriously hot-headed businessman will be rewarded for simply keeping his cool. Clinton backers have been publicly pushing moderator Lester Holt of NBC News to fact-check Trump if he tries to mislead voters about his record and past statements. \n\"All that we're asking is that, if Donald Trump lies, that it's pointed out,\" Mook said. \nTrump's advisers have indeed been urging him to keep calm on stage, mindful of voters' concerns about his temperament. On Saturday, Trump showed a glimpse of the traits his advisers want to keep in check, announcing on Twitter that he might extend a debate invitation to Gennifer Flowers, a woman who had an affair with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton. \nTrump's campaign said the candidate was responding to Clinton's decision to invite businessman and Trump critic Mark Cuban to the debate. And by Sunday morning, they said Flowers would not be attending. \nKellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said the candidate floated the invitation to \"remind people that he's a great counterpuncher.\" \nTrump was often a commanding presence in the Republican primary debates, launching biting personal attacks on his rivals. But at times, he appeared to fade into the background, especially during more technical policy discussions \u2014 something he'll be unable to do with just two candidates on stage. \nClinton has debated more than 30 times at the presidential level, including several one-on-one contests against Obama in 2008 and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016. But Monday's contest will be her first presidential debate against a candidate from the opposing party. \nMook and Conway spoke Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" Priebus appeared on Fox New Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \nLike us on Facebook ", "\n\u2014 Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) September 27, 2016 If we hadn't just lived through the first nine months of 2016, I'd say that Trump's toast. \n\u2014 David French (@DavidAFrench) September 27, 2016 Strong performance by both candidates.

They put support for Merkel's Christian Democrats at 19 or 20 percent, which would be their worst result yet in the state.\nThe center-left Social Democrats, who lead the outgoing state government, were expected to be the strongest party with about 30 percent support.\nMecklenburg-Western Pomerania is home to 1.6 million of Germany's 80 million people and is a relative political lightweight. It is, however, the state where Merkel has her parliamentary constituency, and Sunday's vote was the first of five regional votes before a national election a bit more than a year away.\n\"Perhaps this is the beginning of the end of Angela Merkel's chancellorship today,\" local AfD leader Leif-Erik Holm told supporters. His party, however, fell well short of its aim of becoming the strongest party, and also didn't match the 24.3 percent support it won in another eastern state, Saxony-Anhalt, in March.\nMerkel's refugee policies were a prominent issue in the campaign for Sunday's election, which came a year after she decided to let in migrants from Hungary \u2014 setting off the peak of last year's influx. Germany registered more than 1 million people as asylum-seekers last year.\nNew arrivals in Germany have slowed drastically this year. Still, New Year's Eve robberies and sexual assaults blamed largely on foreigners, as well as two attacks in July carried out by asylum-seekers and claimed by the Islamic State group, have fed tensions.\nMerkel has stuck to her insistence that \"we will manage\" the refugee crisis.\nMecklenburg was the only one of Germany's 16 states where the far-right National Democratic Party was represented in a state legislature, but it appeared to have lost its seats on Sunday. The exit polls put its support below the 5 percent needed to keep them, with many supporters apparently switching to AfD.\nThe state has been run for the past decade by the parties that currently run Germany. Popular Social Democratic governor Erwin Sellering has governed with Merkel's party as his junior partner. Both parties lost support compared with the last state election five years ago, when they polled 35.6 and 23 percent, respectively.\nThe opposition Left Party also lost support, slipping about six points to 12.5 percent, and the left-leaning Greens were hovering around the 5 percent mark.\nThere's no realistic prospect of AfD going into government.", "  Norwich Bulletin Via AP File \nBy Stephen Dinan - The Washington Times \nJean Jacques was fresh out of prison for attempted murder in 2012, and immigration agents wanted to deport him back home to Haiti \u2014 but the island nation\u2019s government refused to take him back, saying it couldn\u2019t be sure Jacques was who he claimed to be.\nAt that point U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement should have enlisted the State Department, then run by Secretary Hillary Clinton, to get involved and put pressure on Haiti, but agents didn\u2019t do that.

Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam ... be allowed to reside or spread within our country.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016, that it was widening efforts to deport Haitians, a response to thousands of immigrants from the Caribbean nation who have overwhelmed California border crossings with Mexico in recent months.

All rights reserved. \nSAN DIEGO (AP) \u2013   The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that it was widening efforts to deport Haitians, a response to thousands of immigrants from the Caribbean nation who have overwhelmed California border crossings with Mexico in recent months.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana testified in Congress that other governments told her on a recent trip to Central America that 40,000 Haitians were on their way and called it an \"emergency situation\" on California's border. She said the estimate of people on their way contributed to the policy shift, as did changing conditions in Haiti.\nThe move lifts special protections that shielded Haitians from deportation after their nation's 2010 earthquake. Since 2011, U.S. authorities have avoided deporting Haitians unless they were convicted of serious crimes or posed a national security threat. Now they will be treated like people from other countries.\nSecretary Jeh Johnson said the new posture doesn't apply to Haitians who got temporary status to live and work in the U.S. after the earthquake and have remained in the country since January 2011.\nThe change may dramatically affect Haitians who have been showing up at U.S. border crossings in California, claiming they lived in Brazil for several years, left for economic reasons, and traveled through Central America and Mexico. Homeland Security officials say about 5,000 Haitians have been stopped at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry since October, compared to only 339 for the 2015 fiscal year. Large numbers have also turned themselves in to U.S. inspectors in Calexico, California, 120 miles east of San Diego.\nThe influx is so heavy that inspectors at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing, are turning back Haitians with appointments to come at a later date, leaving hundreds waiting in Tijuana, Mexico. Many stay at one of the Mexican border city's five migrant shelters that volunteered in May to help.\nThe Rev. Pat Murphy, director of Casa del Migrante in Tijuana, said Haitians arriving at the San Diego crossing on Wednesday wouldn't get an appointment until Oct. 12. His shelter now houses 1,000 people a month, up from 600 before the Haitians began arriving. About half who stay there are Haitians.\n\"We've opened the doors and sometimes we've opened the floors so people can have a place to sleep,\" Murphy said at a news conference Wednesday at San Diego's Christ United Methodist Church, which has provided food, clothing and temporary shelter over the last few months to about 3,000 Haitians after they arrived in the U.S.\nMurphy said 90 percent of the people who have come to his shelter in the last six weeks are Haitians who moved to Brazil after the 2010 earthquake.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement has been releasing many Haitians with notices to appear before an immigration judge, triggering a process that can take years in the overcrowded courts. Many head to Florida, which has a large Haitian community.\nThe new posture subjects Haitian arrivals to enforcement policies that Johnson announced in 2014, which, among other things, make people who are caught at the border a high priority for deportation. Still, if a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer finds they have a \"credible fear\" of persecution at home, they can stay in the country until they appear before an immigration judge for asylum or other relief.\n\"Haitians are not going to be treated any different than anyone else,\" Saldana said at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. \"If they have an ... asylum claim or claim to be a refugee we will consider those claims along with everything else.\"\nIt is unknown if Haiti will agree to take large numbers of its citizens back and how quickly. Presidential elections are scheduled there for Oct. 9.\nJohnson said conditions have improved enough in Haiti to lift the post-earthquake protections against deportation but the toughened stance drew criticism from immigration advocacy groups. Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego, said it betrays a U.S. pledge to assist earthquake victims.\n\"Haiti is not in a situation to accept anyone,\" Guerrero said. \"It all sounds nice for political rhetoric but the reality is if they're going to attempt to deport recent arrivals from Haiti, it's nonsensical and inhumane.\"\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Please ignore these real world events.

(AP Photo/ Pablo Gorondi, file)  (The Associated Press) \nPrevious Next BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2013   Hungarians will vote Sunday in a referendum which Prime Minister Viktor Orban hopes will give his government the popular support it seeks to oppose any future plans by the European Union to resettle asylum seekers among its member states. Here's a look at what's at stake:\nWHAT ORBAN WANTS\nOrban wants to stop the influx of large numbers of Muslim migrants into Europe, arguing they threaten Hungary and Europe's Christian identity and culture. Midway through his third term as prime minister, he suggested last week that the EU should build a \"gigantic refugee city\" in Libya, to where migrants would be deported from Europe to file their asylum claims.\nOrban says the EU needs to strengthen its borders to keep out migrants, like Hungary did last year by building fences on its southern borders with Serbia and Croatia.\nThe referendum's question is \"Do you want the European Union to be able to prescribe the mandatory settlement of non-Hungarian citizens in Hungary even without the consent of Parliament?\"\nOrban says \"no\" votes favor Hungary's sovereignty and independence. He also hopes popular pressure will encourage other EU countries to take similar steps. Critics say poll results showing rising xenophobia and anti-migrant feelings among Hungarians are linked to the government's referendum campaign.\n___\nVOTER TURNOUT\nAt least 50 percent plus one of Hungary's 8.27 million voters need to cast valid ballots for the referendum to be valid.\nDespite an unprecedented barrage of government billboards, advertisements and personal appearances by ministers and lawmakers nationwide urging people to vote, polls show validity is by no means assured, even though \"no\" votes are expected to be in the large majority.\nThe far-right Jobbik party supports the government's anti-migrant position, while most of the other opposition parties and many civic groups are asking voters to either stay home on Sunday or cast invalid ballots.\n\"It's important to show as a citizen that you want to take part,\" says Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee advocacy group. \"However, given the vile nature of this referendum question, we are calling for people to cast an invalid vote.\"\n___\nMIGRANTS? UFOs?\nNearly 400,000 migrants passed through Hungary last year, making their way toward Western Europe. Yet, the criticized razor-wire fences and new expulsion policies have proven effective. During the first four weeks of September, police reported either zero or just one migrant breaching the border area on 12 different days. Last year, Hungary granted asylum to only 508 refugees and a similar number is expected this year.\nThe satirical Hungarian Two-Tailed Dog Party is putting up posters and distributing leaflets mocking the referendum. One of their slogans is that the average Hungarian sees more UFOs in his or her lifetime than migrants.\nFor the record, Hungary's Federation of UFO Research says it receives about two dozen reports a year of UFO sightings across the country.\n___\nTHE FEAR FACTOR\nThe disadvantaged Roma minority, struggling pensioners, young families with children and people living in municipal housing are among those being warned repeatedly of what could happen if Hungary is required to take in refugees.\nAccording to government officials, they may face subsidy or pension cuts, become victims of terrorism and violent acts or be forced to give up their homes if that happens.\nThe government, assisted by state television, is constantly rehashing often months' old stories about migrant attacks.\n\"The image of large migrant groups nearly 'darkening the sky' last year is still present in many people, no doubt reinforced by the government propaganda,\" says Attila Tibor Nagy of the Center for Fair Political Analysis. \"The government is also assisted by the attacks in Germany and France, which it very much likes to invoke to show that migrants are dangerous.\"\n___\nHOW MUCH?\nThe referendum's technical costs, including printing the ballots and manufacturing ballot boxes, total 4.9 billion forints ($17.8 million). The government says it will reveal how much it spent on the billboard and media campaign after the vote, but partial data shows expenditures of at least 13 billion forints ($47.3 million).\nIn contrast, the Two-Tailed Dog Party and a few other opposition groups are working with campaign budgets of around $100,000, gathered from small donations.\n___\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nThe government has not said what consequences a valid referendum supporting its position will have. It has mentioned possible amendments to the constitution but is shying away from specifics. Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs brushed off suggestions that an invalid referendum would hurt Orban, saying a large number of \"no\" votes would be enough to bolster the official position against the refugee quotas even with a low turnout.\n\"The referendum can never become a failure,\" Kovacs says. \"Full stop.\"\nBut Jobbik president Gabor Vona says Orban should resign in case of an invalid ballot and former Socialist Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany says it would weaken Orban's \"infallibility.\"\n\"Brussels has already priced in the referendum and knows well that Hungarian public opinion does not like the migrants,\" said Csaba Toth, strategic director of the Republikon Institute think tank. \"Domestically, nonetheless, a low turnout would be a serious defeat for the prime minister, especially after such a huge campaign.\"", "A refugee set fire to his wife inside a migrant center in the German town of Ruedesheim. \nA 45-year-old man entered the migrant center, where his wife and three children were living, on Thursday.

The two had a cordial press conference in Mexico City where they basically said they agreed to disagree on the issue of immigration.\nBut after Trump\u2019s hardline immigration keynote speech, in a tense interview on Mexican television, Pe\u00f1a Nieto struck a different note, Reuters reported .\n\"His policy stances could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing,\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto said after enduring criticism from opposition politicians who suggested that he had done just that during Trump\u2019s visit. \"That risk, that threat, must be confronted. I told him that is not the way to build a mutually beneficial relationship for both nations.\"\nIn the days leading up to his Mexico trip and immigration address, Trump had appeared to back down from some of the key proposals of his immigration policy, like the creation of an armed force dedicated to deporting undocumented migrants and suggesting that some would be allowed a path to legal status.\nBut his Phoenix speech showed he wasn\u2019t softening his immigration stance.\n\u201cOur message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCan\u2019t do it.

Trump told reporters that while the two men had discussed his proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, they had not discussed who would pay for it. Pe\u00f1a Nieto insisted on TV that he had reiterated his unwillingness to pay for the wall to Trump during their closed door meeting.\n ", "7 P \nDonald Trump heads to Mexico - and then announces his big immigration plan from a border state.

We didn't discuss payment of the wall,\" Trump said.\nTrump said that having a secure border is a sovereign right and something that would be mutually beneficial to both countries.\nFor his part, Pe\u00f1a Nieto walked a fine line, acknowledging the widespread anger that many Mexicans and Mexican-Americans feel toward the proposal, but described the conversation between the two politicians as \"open and constructive.\" He did not, however, shy away from criticizing the U.S. about the amount of firearms that flow into Mexico from the U.S. as a result of the drug trade.\n\u201cAn important number of Americans see the border as a problem because of the number of undocumented immigrants and drugs that cross the border,\u201d he said. \u201cThis does not take into account the millions of illegal dollars and guns that come to Mexico from the U.S.\u201d\nThe Mexican president's tone was much more measure than a few months ago when he compared Trump's rhetoric to that of Adolf Hitler.\n\u201cFirst of all let me tell you, [Trump] is not welcome to Mexico by 130 million people. We don't like him, we don't want him, we reject his visit,\u201d former President Vicente Fox said on Wednesday morning. \u201cI don't understand why President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has offered this opportunity. I think it's nothing more than a political stunt.\u201d\nTrump responded to Fox's criticism on Twitter earlier in the day, saying the former president had, like Pe\u00f1a Nieto, invited him to come to the country when he apologized for \"dropping the f-bomb.\" Fox shot back with a tweet of his own, saying he had invited Trump to \"come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with. Show some respect.\"\nPe\u00f1a Nieto invited both U.S. presidential candidates to come to Mexico City. The inclusion of Trump puzzled many in Mexico, who said it wasn't clear why their own unpopular president would agree to meet with someone so widely disliked in the country.\nMexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pe\u00f1a Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary, but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept.\"\nThe trip, a politically risky move for Trump just ten weeks before Election Day, also came hours before the Republican nominee was expected to deliver a highly-anticipated speech in Arizona about illegal immigration. The issue has been a defining one in Trump's presidential campaign, but also one on which he has appeared to waver in recent days.\n\"The American people are going to see more clearly that there's one candidate in this race who's prepared to take the steps necessary to end the flood of illegal immigration,\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said Wednesday on CNN.\nTrump will also make clear, Pence told CBS, \"that there will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship. People will need to leave the country to be able to obtain legal status or obtain citizenship.\"\nWhile immigration is the hot button issue surrounding Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico, the billionaire businessman also brought up his strong dislike of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which he said \u201chas been a far greater benefit to Mexico than to the United States.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 22-year-old agreement that should be updated,\u201d he added.\nIn his remarks, Pe\u00f1a Nieto took a more positive view of the trade agreement, saying that in his view, \u201cNAFTA has been beneficial to both the United States and Mexico.\u201d\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Driver wasn't an illegal alien.

Bernstein)\nBefore there was Rush Limbaugh, before Sean Hannity, Pat Buchanan and even before Ronald Reagan, there was Phyllis Schlafly.\nFor half a century, she stood rock solid on conservative principles. She single-handedly turning America\u2019s rightwing into a powerful political movement, one that saved our country from disappearing completely down the social and intellectual rat hole known as liberalism.\nI was fortunate enough to see another side of Phyllis Schlafly, one the media won\u2019t mention but with a perspective I won\u2019t forget.\nShe was the Mother Superior of the conservative movement: stern, utterly consistent, unyielding in her adherence to the principles that the Goldwater campaign of 1964 had symbolized and that would eventually put Ronald Reagan into the White House. Those principles were a commitment to limited government, the rule of law and constitutional principles, and a strong America aboard and a morally virtuous America at home: the bedrock of American conservatism that Schlafly fought for all her life.\nJust as Rush Limbaugh turned AM radio into a tool for conservative ideas, Phyllis Schlafly turned direct mail into a potent tool for promoting and extending that conservative faith. And when Republicans turned away from that faith, as they did during the Bush years\u2014particularly on illegal immigration--they felt the sting of the Mother Superior\u2019s steel ruler across their knuckles.\nShe was utterly fearless and utterly consistent and not a little intimidating in person, which I discovered first hand when meeting her at a conference a few years ago.\nI was there to sign copies of my book \" Freedom\u2019s Forge ,\" about how American businessmen built the arsenal of democracy that sustained America and the Allies during World War Two, and eventually won the war. She was immediately intrigued, bought a copy and had me inscribe it.\nA few days later I got a call from her producer: Phyllis Schlafly wanted to discuss \" Freedom\u2019s Forge \" on her radio show. I had done many radio shows in the past\u2014Larry Elder, Sean Hannity, Brian Kilmeade, G. Gordon Liddy, even Rush Limbaugh had read excerpts from one of my books on the air\u2014but this invitation was special.\nWe had a wonderful time. Afterwards Phyllis called me up to thank me and tell me how much she enjoyed doing the show.\nThe highlight of the interview came at the very end, when Phyllis asked me if I had any stories about the arsenal of democracy that weren\u2019t in the book. I told the story about Hersheys and D Rations, the special rations that were to be issued to airmen and sailors to insert in their life vests, in case they had to ditch in the ocean or abandon ship that would keep them alive for two or more days when there was no other food or water. The navy scientists thought about a chocolate bar and approached the Hershey company, which was already shipping hundreds of thousands of chocolate bars to American service personnel around the world.\nCould Hershey make the D ration bar, they asked, but with one stipulation: it had to have the taste of boiled potatoes, so that service men wouldn\u2019t be tempted to eat the D Ration instead of leaving it in their vests.\nThe Hershey executives had never been asked before to produce a chocolate that tasted terrible, I told Schafly and her audience, but they put on a straight face and said yes, they could figure out how to do it, and did\u2014producing D Rations by the billions.\nWhen I finished the story, Phyllis Schlafly laughed so loud and long she could barely close out the show.\nYes, I actually heard Phyllis Schlafly laugh. It\u2019s a memory I always treasure, just as America should and will always treasure this remarkable, fearless icon.\nHistorian Arthur Herman is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C.

The full review won't be completed until spring at the earliest.\nThe expanded review will include issues raised by scientists in the United States and Canada, and it'll also consider economic impact and means of protecting native lobsters other than an outright ban, the European Union's executive body said Tuesday in a statement.\nIt's unclear how the American lobsters ended up in Swedish waters.\nSweden's Agency for Marine and Water Management contends the country is right to be cautious about the appearance of a foreign species. The agency also says more research is needed into the impact of cross-breeding of American and European lobsters.\nBut Robert S. Steneck, a University of Maine scientist, said there's no evidence of successful reproduction resulting in new American or hybrid lobsters in Europe, possibly because of water temperatures or unsuitable nursery habitat for American lobster.\nSteneck said the risk of American lobsters becoming invasive in Europe is \"vanishingly small.\"\n\"I doubt there is evidence that the American lobster can increase in abundance to the point it creates measurable harm to the ecosystem or to humans. Those are the criteria on which 'invasive species' are defined,\" Steneck said.\nThe National Fisheries Institute, a U.S. seafood trade association, also criticized the EU actions.\n\"You might get hit by a car crossing the street but that doesn't mean the only way to avoid such risk is never crossing the street,\" spokesman Gavin Gibbons said. \"This is an attempt to supposedly introduce a zero-risk solution to an issue that numerous researchers have said is not a genuine scientific concern.\"\nMaine lobstermen like Arnie Gamage Jr. question how the lobsters got into Swedish waters in the first place.

The group includes Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country, with Greece, is Europe's main immigration gateway.\nAhead of the talks, a government spokesman on immigration said Athens rejects reactivation of the so-called Dublin Regulation, which would allow other EU members to send asylum-seekers back to Greece.\n\"A country such as Greece which receives a large number of refugees from Turkey, and also hosts a large number of refugees \u2014 practically without any outside help \u2014 cannot be asked to receive refugees from other European countries,\" Giorgos Kyritsis told The Associated Press. \"That would be outrageous.\"\nThe Dublin Regulation that governs the Schengen passport-free area stipulates that people wishing to apply for asylum must do so in the first member country they arrive in. In most cases that was Greece, whose eastern islands were overwhelmed last year by migrants packed into smugglers boats from Turkey. But even before last year's migration crisis, many of its EU partners had stopped enforcing the rule because Greece's asylum and migrant reception systems were below standard.\nNow, however, both Germany and the EU executive are pressing for the rule to be restored, with EU officials saying that Greece must meet the Dublin standards by the end of this year.\nBrad Blitz, migration expert and professor of international politics at Middlesex University in Britain, said sending large numbers of asylum-seekers back to Greece would apply an ever greater strain on the country's asylum system and reception capacity.\n\"Unless there is an effective means of redistribution across the EU, a revised Dublin system will force refugees upon receiving states closest to the external border, above all Greece, Italy and to a lesser extent Spain,\" he said.\n\"It will do so by insisting they apply for asylum in Greece, and potentially by returning them from other EU states to Greece. In sum, this will enable returns and discourage EU states from accepting more refugees, including Greece,\" Blitz said.\nKyritsis, the government official, said Greece considers the Dublin rule to be \"practically dead\" because it does not address current migratory pressures and should be drastically overhauled. He added that calls for its reintroduction are to a degree linked with domestic political concerns in Germany, and he argued that EU members are lagging in implementing commitments to take in refugees from Greece \u2014 part of an EU-Turkey deal this year to stem the migratory flow.\nKyritsis said the migrant relocation deal ought to have seen 33,000 people transferred to other EU countries from Greece so far. Instead, only 3,000 have made the journey.\n\"There are 7,000 people ready and waiting to be relocated, so in this field other European countries and the European Union do not appear to ... have done what they ought to have done,\" he said.\nAbout 60,000 refugees and other migrants remain trapped in Greece since a series of Balkan border closures in March, which were closely followed by a March EU-Turkey deal that provides for the return to Turkey of all migrants who get across to Greece.\nHuman rights groups have criticized the agreement, saying it condemns refugees to an uncertain future in Turkey, and implementation has proved problematic as Greek authorities struggle to process asylum bids by people arguing that they shouldn't be sent back.\nThe agreement is also looking increasingly shaky following disagreements over visa-free entry to the EU for Turks and simmering tensions between individual bloc members and Turkey.\nKyritsis, however, said Athens has no indication that the deal will not hold.\n\"There are problems, a negotiation is under way ... we hope for the best,\" he said.\nFriday's talks are in preparation for next week's informal EU summit in Bratislava, although Greek organizers insist it's not an attempt to heighten division between Europe's prosperous north and financially beleaguered south.\nGreece's left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, together with Italy's Renzi, French President Francois Hollande and the leaders of Portugal, Cyprus and Malta, will also be discussing investment and job creation, as well as security.

After claiming to have sent investigators to Hawaii to look into whether Obama was foreign-born, Trump announced, \u201cThey can\u2019t believe what they are finding.\u201d In 2012, he tweeted that \u201can extremely credible source\u201d had told him that Obama was a \u201cfraud.\u201d Just last year, Trump refused to say whether he thought Obama was a legitimate president.  \nAbsent repudiation from the candidate himself, Trump\u2019s \"birtherism\" cannot be overlooked or forgiven. Trump\u2019s advisors may be having a change of heart on \"birtherism\" because, now that the polls are tightening, the campaign has realized the importance of the African-American vote. But African-Americans of all political affiliations are offended by Trump\u2019s suggestion that the country\u2019s first Black president is not legitimate. No wonder that Trump polls in the single digits among African-Americans (in some polls, he polls at zero with Blacks). If the campaign thinks a visit by Trump to a Black church might somehow turn things around, they are mistaken. The damage has been done.  \nLatinos can look at Trump\u2019s treatment of President Obama and see, by extension, how the candidate views us. To Trump, Obama is the other, foreign, and therefore undeserving of respect. That\u2019s pretty much the way Trump sees our community, too. He started his campaign insulting Mexicans and immigrants. He booted Jorge Ramos out of a press conference. He maligned a distinguished American judge solely on the basis of his Mexican heritage. And this is someone who wants to lead the nation?      \nEven worse, Trump\u2019s embrace of \"birtherism\" is undermining our democracy. Among Trump supporters, 59 percent believe that President Obama was not born in the U.S. NBC News reports that 72 percent of registered Republican voters still have doubts about the president\u2019s citizenship. What is troubling is that Trump has taken an idea with no basis in fact and successfully sold it to part of the electorate. This is dangerous, because the more that the public loses faith in the legitimacy of our government, the weaker we are as a country.  \nLately Trump says that he doesn\u2019t want to discuss \"birtherism\" anymore. \"I don\u2019t talk about it because if I talk about that, your whole thing will be about that,\u201d he told reporters on his plane last week. That\u2019s not good enough; it\u2019s no apology and he still will not acknowledge that our president was born in this country. Equally shameful is that some of Trump\u2019s supporters have floated the idea that Hillary Clinton was responsible for elevating \"birtherism\" in the public arena, a claim that has been debunked by Politifact, FactCheck.org, and the Washington Post.\n\nSure, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton have made indiscreet remarks \u2014 and they have apologized for them. Just this weekend, Clinton expressed \u201cregret\u201d and said she was \u201cwrong\u201d for calling half of Trump supporters \u201cdeplorables.\u201d Trump should be held to the same standard as any other candidate or president: when you say something wrong, apologize. Besides, it is poor strategy for Trump not to disavow his association with \"birtherism.\" \nIf he apologizes soon, he can put it behind him. If he does not, the topic will certainly come in during the debates, where he cannot control the narrative. Then again, as the New York Times pointed out, \u201cIn the 'birther' movement, Mr. Trump recognized an opportunity to connect with the electorate over an issue many considered taboo: the discomfort, in some quarters of American society, with the election of the nation\u2019s first black president.\u201d \nHow ironic that Trump has probed deeply into Obama\u2019s background while refusing to disclose his own detailed medical history, his tax returns, or information about his wife\u2019s immigration history.  \n\n\"Birtherism\" is toxic, discredited, and indefensible. That Trump has not renounced it is a national disgrace.\n\nRaul A.

Kolb   livefyre Email Print \nA surge of unaccompanied children coming across the southern border could be swelling the ranks of one of America\u2019s most dangerous gangs, either as fresh recruits or hardened sleepers, according to federal authorities. \nSome 227,149 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the border over the last six years, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. They remain in federal custody until a sponsor can be located, at which time they are often sent to communities where they are ripe for recruitment by Latin gangs such as the infamous MS-13. \n\u201cOur safety standards have increased,\u201d Andrea Helling, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIn the last few months screening procedures of children and sponsors has increased in their intensity which we hadn\u2019t done previously.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract MS 13 started in the prisons of El Salvador, but has spread throughout the continent. (Associated Press) \nFederal law requires the Department of Homeland Security transfer children under 18 to the custody of Helling\u2019s agency until they are released to an appropriate sponsor, usually a relative, while their immigration cases are adjudicated. Some observers say that, at the least, the process sends a steady stream of loosely supervised youths lacking in language and coping skills right into the waiting arms of criminal gangs. At worst, the unaccompanied minors were already initiated into the gangs before they arrived at the border. \nMS-13 is believed to be among the largest street gangs on New York\u2019s Long Island, and more than 250 members have been convicted on federal felony charges since 2003. Federal prosecutors there have pinned more than 20 murders on the violent gang. \nMeanwhile, over the last year, Long Island has received 2,093 unaccompanied children, and between October 2013 and July 2016, all of New York received 12,478 children from Central America. The overwhelming majority of the kids are not criminals and likely have competent sponsors. But some are. \nIn June 2015, MS-13 members and El Salvadoran immigrants Jose Cornejo, 17, Bryan Larios, 18 and Joel Escobar, 17, all of Brentwood, N.Y. were charged with the brutal rape of a 16 year-old girl on a local golf course. \nEarlier this week, Joshua Guzman, 15, was shot and killed in the Long Island city of Hempstead. While not an unaccompanied immigrant, the boy\u2019s father, Raul Guzman, told Newsday his son was under pressure to join a gang. Police believe his murder may be related. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the possibility,\u201d said Lt. Richard LeBrun, spokesman, Nassau County Police Department, that Guzman\u2019s murder could be gang related. \nMS-13 has a foothold in numerous other communities, where unaccompanied minors are being sent. Texas, which has seen a spike in MS-13 crime has received 15,999 over the same period. The 2015 Texas Department of Public Safety Gang Threat Assessment found MS-13 boasts some 800 members, and authorities explicitly blamed the flood of unaccompanied children being placed in the state. \n\u201cThe influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas in 2014, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year,\u201d the report stated. \nOther areas that have seen an influx in MS-13 crime are Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. Fairfax County, Va. has seen a 160 percent increase in MS-13 related incidents through April compared to the previous year. \nHelling said HHS is looking more closely at the sponsors who step forward to take custody of the minors. \n\u201cOur responsibility is providing a safe place for these children,\u201d she said. \nShe said that high-risk children who may have been identified as gang members by DHS would likely be placed in either a staff secure or secure-juvenile detention facility. But even if they are not gang members when they come into the U.S., the risk remains that they could fall prey to recruitment efforts.

If the race remains close leading up to Nov. 8, getting their support, and getting them to the polls, will be particularly crucial, experts say.\nDespite Clinton's advantages, including a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation and a favorable electoral map, Trump has gained on the former secretary of state.\nClinton has tended to poll better among Latinos than Trump, whose remarks about mass deportation and Mexico -- as well as his doubts that an Indiana-born judge presiding over a Trump University case can be objective because of his Mexican heritage \u2013 have alienated many Hispanics.\n\"African Americans, Hispanics, are living in hell,\" said Trump in answer to a question about racial unrest in cities across the country following police shooting.\nTrump also denounced gangs made up of undocumented immigrants when he was discussing the violence in urban areas.\nThe centerpiece of Trump's campaign has been a push for restrictive immigration measures, including a physical wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and an early proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from coming to the U.S.\nAbout 75 minutes into the expected 90-minute debate, the issue of immigration did not arise, except for Trump's remark that the union of immigration agents had endorsed him.\nAt the Republican National Convention in July, and in a major speech about immigration in recent weeks, Trump put a spotlight on undocumented immigrants who had killed Americans, inviting the victims\u2019 relatives to the stage to talk about their painful experiences.\nClinton has called for expanding President Barack Obama's executive orders if Congress won't pass legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system.\nSurveys of Latinos, however, show a lack of enthusiasm over Clinton, for many of the same reasons other voters who lean Democratic have tempered support for her.\nNational interest in the race has been intense, and the campaigns were expecting a record-breaking audience to watch Monday's event \u2013 the first of three -- at suburban New York's Hofstra University.\nTrump and Clinton have spent months tangling from afar and are divided on virtually every major issue facing the country.\nWhile Trump has spoken often about building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and vowing to implement what he has termed extreme vetting of people wanting to some to the United States to live or work, he's been less detailed about other ideas, including his plan for stamping out the Islamic State group in the Middle East, and Conway suggested he'd be similarly reticent in the debate.\nClinton is banking on voters seeing her as a steady hand who can build on the record of President Barack Obama, whose popularity is rising as he winds down his second term in office.\nTrump was often a commanding presence in the Republican primary debates, launching biting personal attacks on his rivals. But at other times, he appeared to fade into the background, especially during more technical policy discussions \u2014 something he could not do with two candidates on stage.\nClinton has debated more than 30 times at the presidential level, including several one-on-one contests against Obama in 2008 and Vermont Sen.

Some of the ISIS leaders are Chechens who hold a \"special place\" with the terror group, said Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition.\nOne of the critical tasks facing the Iraqi government in retaking Mosul from ISIS is handling as many as 800,000 refugees expected to pour out of Mosul after ISIS is defeated, Dorrian said. He adds that refugee screening is one of the most important components of the Mosul operation, saying it's a conversation the U.S.-led coalition has with the Iraqis \"every day.\"   Dorrian says the screening process must be done under the \"command and control\" of the Iraqi government.\nIn June, following the liberation of Fallujah by Iraqi forces, hundreds of Iraqi Sunni refugees escaping the city reportedly were abducted and later killed by Iranian-backed forces outside the city, including Kataaib Hezbollah. The State Department labeled the group a terrorist organization in 2009 for attacking U.S. forces in Iraq. \n The United Nations reported in July that 900 Iraqi refugees who left Fallujah were missing and at least 50 had been executed and blamed Iraqi Shia militias, many backed by Iran.\nSome of these Iranian-backed forces are now located on the outskirts of Mosul, according to U.S. officials. \nDorrian said the 615 additional troops going to Iraq, an increase that Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced Wednesday, would be the last boost needed to help the Iraqis take Mosul. \"We believe this is all the force we will need to liberate Mosul,\" he said.\nDorrian said a sizable number of the new U.S. troops going to Iraq are intelligence personnel that will be needed to sift through terabytes of information ISIS fighters are expected to leave behind when they either escape the city or are killed.\nWhen the ISIS supply hub of Manbij was liberated near Syria's border with Turkey, U.S.-backed forces recovered 20 terabytes of information, Dorian said. He called it a \"treasure trove\" of information about ISIS that has since been shared with Western intelligence agencies including those in Europe.\nWhen asked why some troops are going to a remote airbase in western Iraq's Anbar province, Dorrian said the goal is to turn al-Asad airbase located northwest of Ramadi into a 24/7 airport to fly drones and support Iraqi military aircraft.  At the moment, the airbase can only support daytime operations, he said.\n\nLucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News Channel.

That will be determined on Nov. 8.\nSanchez beats all U.S. Representatives who are running for an office, other than the one they already have, in number of absences for House votes.\nSanchez appeared for only 22 of 63 votes, according to Roll Call. \nThe news outlet said that House members who are running for a different office \u2013 most of them for Senate seats \u2013 miss more votes after Labor Day.\nSanchez is running for Boxer\u2019s seat against California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who also is a Democrat and is the prohibitive frontrunner with a double-digit lead in the most recent polls.\nThe California legislator's campaign did not comment for the Roll Call story.\nOn average, House members vote in about 96 percent of roll call votes. Seven members voted below that. Besides Sanchez, they included Democrats John Carney of Delaware, Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and Republicans Todd Young of Indiana, Candice S. Miller of Michigan and Charles Boustany Jr. of Louisiana, according to Roll Call.\n\u201cAnn has been hard at work, which is why the House passed her bipartisan legislation to protect [Veterans Affairs] whistle-blowers and hold the VA accountable just last week,\u201d said D.B. Mitchell, a spokesman for Kirkpatrick, who is running against Republican Sen. John McCain. \n\u201cAnd it\u2019s no secret Ann logs thousands of miles traveling across Arizona to listen to and share the concerns of families who want better paying jobs, stronger schools and comprehensive immigration reform after John McCain's 33 years in Washington,\u201d Mitchell said.\nDuckworth said in an interview with the Chicago CBS affiliate WBBM that he is mindful of the votes he's missing and makes sure not to miss critical ones.\n\u201cWhen there are votes in Congress to actually get something done, I\u2019d be more than happy to go and vote,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately \u2026 as you\u2019ll see, we\u2019re not doing much in Washington in terms of getting the job done.\u201d\nMissed votes became a high-profile issue during the GOP presidential primaries, with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida being targeted by rivals during debates for not doing the job his constituents had elected him to do.\nHis one-time mentor, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who also ran for president, made a point of criticizing Rubio for neglecting his senatorial duties.\nRubio\u2019s challenger as he now seeks re-election to the Senate, Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy, has kept a spotlight on the Cuban-American politician's absences during his presidential bid. Murphy, Roll Call notes, is among four House members running for an office other than their own who has not missed a single vote in September.\nAccording to Roll Call, McCain, who is seeking his sixth term, has not missed votes in the Senate, though he missed many when he ran for president.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "They can set up a refugee camp in the 9th ward.", "  EFE Mexico City \u2013   U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said here Thursday that economic isolation is not beneficial in world of globalization and technological change, and he acknowledged that the changing current environment has affected U.S. society.\n\"Isolating economies and people cannot stop technology, and slower growth cannot improve lives,\" Lew said in a speech before hundreds of students at the Mexican Autonomous Institute of Technology, or ITAM.\nHe said that \"rejecting change is not a solution\" and, in the face of \"powerful forces\" like globalization and technological change, Mexico and the United States must \"redouble our commitment to inclusive growth that spreads opportunity broadly and offers support to those who are most disrupted by transition.\"\n\"We must win the argument - one that is supported by the facts - that fair trade will grow both of our economies,\" Lew emphasized, alluding to facts of the kind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton presented in the first presidential debate last week.\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump has proposed renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement because he feels it harms the economy of the United States, and he has also said he would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to halt illegal immigration.\nLew, in his speech, also spoke of the importance of ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership and increasing security along the border with Mexico, and he concluded by saying that \"Building barriers that will reduce economic growth is not an answer.\"", "  Associated Press   Email Print In this Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015 photo, Delphine Qasu, 18, right, a Yazidi refugee from Sinjar, Iraq, is comforted by her brother Dilshad, 17, while crying after talking about their journey to reach Germany, at their new temporary home at Patrick Henry Village, in Heidelberg, Germany.

Thousands more will listen or watch around the world in nearly 100 languages on television, radio, satellite and internet broadcasts. \nLeaders from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints give carefully crafted speeches and make announcements about church statistics, new temples or initiatives. \nA look where the church stands on some topics that could come up during speeches: \nREFUGEES \nThe church has led a push to be welcoming toward refugees around the world at a time when some others are tightening the hatches. \nMormon leaders sent a letter a year ago urging its members to help and launched a refugee relief effort campaign in March called \"I Was A Stranger.\" Last month, the church posted a new video on its website showing how members can mentor refugees. \nThe embrace of refugees by the religion has roots in the history of the faith, which counted many immigrants among its early members. Mormons also reflect back on their own ancestors, pioneers who crossed the country looking for a place to settle and practice their beliefs. \"Their story is our story \u2014 and not that long ago,\" said Patrick Kearon, a member of a second-tier leadership council at the last church conference in April. \nOne of the highest ranking current leaders, Dieter F. Uchtdorf, was a refugee as a child when his family fled the Czech Republic amid war and moved to Germany. \nPOLITICAL CIVILITY and ELECTIONS \nMormon leaders are not expected to mention presidential candidates by name, but they could advocate again for public civility and compassion as their mostly Republican members decide how to vote in November amid a general distaste for the brash Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nAt the April conference, leaders called on members to practice tolerance despite political differences but stayed true to the faith's pledge to maintain political neutrality by refraining from backing one party or endorsing candidates. \nTrump's inability to connect with Mormon voters has led to significantly fewer Latter-day Saints identifying as Republicans this year compared to four years ago when Mitt Romney, a Mormon himself, was the party's presidential nominee, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. \nAmong the religion's top 15 leaders, six are registered Republican while nine are unaffiliated voters, according to Utah public records obtained by The Associated Press. Church President Thomas S. Monson is a Republican. \nFour years ago, 11 of the top 15 Mormon leaders were Republicans and four were unaffiliated, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. \nRELIGIOUS LIBERTY and LGBT ISSUES \nMormon leaders have been preaching the importance of preserving religious liberty while also calling on members to accept and adhere to the legalization of same-sex marriage by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe church still opposes gay marriage and drew the ire of gay rights advocates and many church members for banning baptisms last year for children living with gay parents. But, the religion has tried to soften its tone in recent years to become more accepting of gays and lesbians. \nBetween gay rights and religious freedom, even criticizing Kentucky clerk Kim Davis for refusing to license gay marriages. With church support, Utah passed a state law that protects gay and transgender people from housing and employment discrimination, while also protecting the rights of religious groups and individuals. \nLeaders came out in December with a statement in support of religious freedom in the wake of Donald Trump's proposal for a total ban on Muslims entering the United States. \nAt a women's conference last weekend, a top female leader called on members to defend the religion's beliefs on marriage, family and sexuality while being sensitive to other people's views. \n\"I worry that we live in such an atmosphere of avoiding offense that we sometimes altogether avoid teaching correct principles,\" said Bonnie Oscarson, president of the church's Young Women organization.

Politico, in a news story , said Trump had been \u201cplaying at diplomacy in Mexico,\u201d that his speech made clear that what happened there, \u201cmuch like his campaign's two-weeks of gentle walkbacks, was a ruse.\u201d And, for good measure, called the entire episode a \u201cfarce.\u201d \nBut let\u2019s take a step back. Even some of Trump\u2019s harshest critics gave him kudos for the gamble he took in Mexico City. He appeared on the world stage with Enrique Pena Nieto, handled himself well, and both men spoke of having an open and constructive conversation.\nSure, Trump had claimed that making Mexico pay for a border wall hadn\u2019t come up, while Pena Nieto later said he made clear his country would do no such thing. But diplomacy doesn\u2019t mean hammering away on the most divisive issue the first time you meet a foreign leader, especially if you\u2019re, well, not yet president.\nEvery challenger, and especially one who\u2019s never held elective office, has to pass a commander-in-chief test.

See Latest Coverage \u2192 \nBut instead he gave the loud and fiery address in Phoenix, and the New York Times couldn\u2019t hide its disdain:\n\u201cYet the juxtaposition of Mr. Trump\u2019s dual performances was so jarring that his true vision and intentions on immigration were hard to discern. He displayed an almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon in Mexico, appearing measured and diplomatic, while hours later he took the stage at his campaign rally and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders, rapes and other heinous violence.\u201d\nFor the record, I don\u2019t believe he denounced illegal immigrants \u201con the whole\u201d as criminals, though he certainly played up the dangers of allowing them to stay here without being vetted and emphasized that those with criminal records would be booted out.\n(The Times piece also went through a significant rewrite after the first edition, as you can see here .) \nMuch of the press didn\u2019t really credit Trump for dropping his mass deportation plan in favor of dealing with the non-criminals of the 11 million illegal immigrants in several years, after the rest of his plan is in place. Instead, there were observations that his base might not like the change.\nAnd while the left trashed the speech as \u201cunhinged and demagogic,\u201d as Salon put it, the underlying tone elsewhere was that Trump was consumed with throwing red meat to the anti-immigrant crowd, and parading relatives of those killed by illegal immigrants.\nBy yesterday, Trump was back to telling supporter Laura Ingraham on her radio show that \u201cthere\u2019s quite a bit of softening\u201d in his plan.\nNow there\u2019s legitimate media criticism to be made of whether Trump was sending mixed messages at Wednesday\u2019s twin events, and whether the speech did nothing to draw moderate voters to his cause.\nBut for a decade now, the mainstream media mindset has been in favor of modest immigration reform. That was true when George W. Bush was pushing it. It was true with the Republican \u201cautopsy\u201d after 2012. It was true when Marco Rubio and the Gang of 8 were trying to push a compromise measure through Congress.\nThat\u2019s why the pundits were so surprised when Trump won the nomination after embracing such ideas as a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. He\u2019s playing on a bigger field now, of course, but on this issue, at least, much of the media still find his message distasteful.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action but most live under the risk of being removed from the country. \nVeterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits. \nThe quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status. \n___ \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016, in Phoenix.

Franklin) \u00a9 The Associated Press Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) \nTRUMP: \"When politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages ... It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\" \nTHE FACTS: No politician of either party who supports overhauling immigration laws supports \"amnesty,\" but the meaning of \"amnesty\" varies depending on who is talking. \nThe sweeping and bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 was derided by opponents as amnesty, but supporters including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida disputed that, noting numerous requirements imposed on immigrants in the country illegally along a 13-year path to citizenship, including paying penalties. \nThe bill proposed spending tens of billions of dollars to double the number of border patrol agents and greatly increase border security. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the bill and projected that it would lower wages for the entire workforce slightly over the first 10 years after becoming law, but would then increase wages for the entire workforce by even more, at the same time boosting economic output and increasing the GDP. \n___ \nTRUMP, on the number of people in the U.S. illegally: \"Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\" \nTHE FACTS: The government actually has an idea. The Homeland Security Department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate. \nThe figure comes from an analysis of the most recent Census Data. The government compares the number of people whom the Census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government. \nExperts believe the number of people in the U.S. illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle. \n___ \nTRUMP, on ending the practice of releasing people who are caught crossing the border illegally, pending a court appearance: \"We are going to end catch-and-release ... Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\" \nTHE FACTS: Many of the releases in question were ordered by courts. They were not a policy of the Obama administration. \nA federal judge in Los Angeles ruled last year the federal government's detention of children and their mothers who were caught crossing the border illegally violated a 1997 court settlement. In July, an appeals court narrowed the scope, saying children must be quickly released but not their parents. From October through July, 48,311 unaccompanied children were arrested crossing the border from Mexico; many more children were caught with their families. \nMany crossing the border illegally claim asylum, which must be adjudicated by an immigration judge. People can claim asylum because they are being persecuted or fear persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion. \n___ \nTRUMP, after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto: \"I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has been to the United States and that it must be improved upon. ... I expressed that ... we must take action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country. It's happening every day, it's getting worse and worse and worse, and we have to stop it.\" \nTHE FACTS: The loss of manufacturing jobs is generally attributed to China, not Mexico. \nSome U.S. companies have moved jobs to Mexico \u2014 the Carrier Corp. recently decided to relocate an air conditioning factory there from Indiana. But there is little data to show that the trend is getting \"worse and worse.\" \nNo reliable annual measures exist of job flows between the U.S. and Mexico. The United States hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, when more than 5.5 million were lost, but most economists blame the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and the increasing automation of many factories. \nRecently, manufacturing has done a bit better: Since 2010, U.S. manufacturing jobs have increased by about 900,000. And many economists credit NAFTA with helping the U.S. auto industry by providing a cheap source of parts that otherwise might have been sourced in China. A report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that imports of subsidized U.S. agricultural products put as many as 2 million Mexican farmers out of work. And since NAFTA's implementation in 1994, Mexico has grown more slowly than many of its Latin American counterparts. \n___ \nTRUMP: \"We didn't discuss that. We didn't discuss who pays for the wall, we didn't discuss.\" ... \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.\" \nPENA NIETO on Twitter, in Spanish: \"At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" \nTHE FACTS: The facts may depend on what your definition of a discussion is. If the Mexican president opened with a comment that his country won't pay for the wall and Trump did not respond to it, that may not have been a discussion in his mind. But the subject, it seems, came up. The Trump campaign's brief statement on the meeting did not quibble with Pena Nieto's account. It said the meeting \"was not a negotiation.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Erica Werner in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report. Riccardi reported from Kansas City, Mo. From the Channel", "By Lili Gil Valletta \nPublished September 01, 2016 Fox News Latino Getty Images \nAs we witness a Trump makeover in the last few weeks, analysts and strategists today wonder whether this evolution will make a difference with one of America\u2019s fastest growing population segments: Hispanics. \nBetween 2000 and 2012, Hispanics grew by nearly 49 percent according to census data, while growth has only been 5.8 percent for the rest of the population. \nIt is not just what he is saying but how he is saying it what is driving negative opinion among Hispanics. - Liliana Gil-Valetta\nThis year there are an estimated 27.3 million eligible Hispanic voters, of which half are millennials. And, particularly in key states such as Florida, Colorado and Nevada, Latinos will make a winning or loosing difference. \nBut is immigration the winning topic? \nIt seems both campaigns are banking on it, with a new ad from the Clinton campaign highlighting Trump\u2019s harsh immigrations remarks while Trump acts diplomatic in Mexico and later hosts a big immigration speech. \nPutting assumptions and emotion aside, what does the analysis of the unbiased voice and opinion generated by hundreds of thousands of Hispanic digital discussions reveal about the candidates? Net, net, it is not about immigration alone. \nBack in June, as published on Fox News Latino, we ran a report using a proprietary big data methodology, CulturIntel\u2122, including search, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools which revealed a rise in positive opinion among Hispanics for Trump at 37 percent; while Clinton was at 41 percent. \nWhile the skeptics personally questioned me live on shows like The O\u2019Reilly Factor, it was hard to argue against over a million Hispanic discussion data points. This is why, in the advent of much discussion surrounding immigration we decided to run yet one more report to get to the facts behind Trump\u2019s and Clinton\u2019s drivers and barriers among Hispanics. \nRecent analysis of almost 300,000 Hispanic discussions from June 1 to August 21, 2016 reports Trump declining from 37 percent as of June 1, to 13 percent positive opinion among Hispanics and Clinton at 31 percent versus 41 percent positive opinion among Hispanics as of June 1, revealing that both are declining among this important segment. \nFurther analysis outlines the drivers and barriers for each candidate among Hispanics, which reveal important levers the candidates, and their campaign advisors could pull, beyond immigration. \nBottom line, jobs and the economy are the top issue for Hispanics, based on analysis of over 142 million Hispanic discussions over 12 months, as of June 10, 2016, followed by education and health care. In fact, immigration ranks as the number seven key issue for Hispanics overall and ranks as the number four issue for Hispanic millennials, who make up almost half of Latino voters.\nhttp://culturintel.tumblr.com/post/149780506878 \nPositive opinion for Trump among Hispanics is driven primarily by the fact that he is not a politician, at 38 percent, followed by his economic and business experience at 28 percent. Clinton\u2019s positive opinion among Hispanics is driven by her political experience at 26 percent followed by her domestic policies at 24 percent. In fact, immigration gets the lower percentage of all factors driving her positive opinion, at 16 percent. \nIn contrast, the negative views among Hispanics for Trump are his temperament at 26 percent, intolerance at 26 percent, with immigration as the number-three barrier at 21 percent.

Kolb   livefyre Email Print \nA surge of unaccompanied children coming across the southern border could be swelling the ranks of one of America\u2019s most dangerous gangs, either as fresh recruits or hardened sleepers, according to federal authorities. \nSome 227,149 unaccompanied children have been apprehended at the border over the last six years, according to the U.S. Border Patrol. They remain in federal custody until a sponsor can be located, at which time they are often sent to communities where they are ripe for recruitment by Latin gangs such as the infamous MS-13. \n\u201cOur safety standards have increased,\u201d Andrea Helling, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told FoxNews.com. \u201cIn the last few months screening procedures of children and sponsors has increased in their intensity which we hadn\u2019t done previously.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract MS 13 started in the prisons of El Salvador, but has spread throughout the continent. (Associated Press) \nFederal law requires the Department of Homeland Security transfer children under 18 to the custody of Helling\u2019s agency until they are released to an appropriate sponsor, usually a relative, while their immigration cases are adjudicated. Some observers say that, at the least, the process sends a steady stream of loosely supervised youths lacking in language and coping skills right into the waiting arms of criminal gangs. At worst, the unaccompanied minors were already initiated into the gangs before they arrived at the border. \nMS-13 is believed to be among the largest street gangs on New York\u2019s Long Island, and more than 250 members have been convicted on federal felony charges since 2003. Federal prosecutors there have pinned more than 20 murders on the violent gang. \nMeanwhile, over the last year, Long Island has received 2,093 unaccompanied children, and between October 2013 and July 2016, all of New York received 12,478 children from Central America. The overwhelming majority of the kids are not criminals and likely have competent sponsors. But some are. \nIn June 2015, MS-13 members and El Salvadoran immigrants Jose Cornejo, 17, Bryan Larios, 18 and Joel Escobar, 17, all of Brentwood, N.Y. were charged with the brutal rape of a 16 year-old girl on a local golf course. \nEarlier this week, Joshua Guzman, 15, was shot and killed in the Long Island city of Hempstead. While not an unaccompanied immigrant, the boy\u2019s father, Raul Guzman, told Newsday his son was under pressure to join a gang. Police believe his murder may be related. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the possibility,\u201d said Lt. Richard LeBrun, spokesman, Nassau County Police Department, that Guzman\u2019s murder could be gang related. \nMS-13 has a foothold in numerous other communities, where unaccompanied minors are being sent. Texas, which has seen a spike in MS-13 crime has received 15,999 over the same period. The 2015 Texas Department of Public Safety Gang Threat Assessment found MS-13 boasts some 800 members, and authorities explicitly blamed the flood of unaccompanied children being placed in the state. \n\u201cThe influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas in 2014, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year,\u201d the report stated. \nOther areas that have seen an influx in MS-13 crime are Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. Fairfax County, Va. has seen a 160 percent increase in MS-13 related incidents through April compared to the previous year. \nHelling said HHS is looking more closely at the sponsors who step forward to take custody of the minors. \n\u201cOur responsibility is providing a safe place for these children,\u201d she said. \nShe said that high-risk children who may have been identified as gang members by DHS would likely be placed in either a staff secure or secure-juvenile detention facility. But even if they are not gang members when they come into the U.S., the risk remains that they could fall prey to recruitment efforts.

HuertaforCongress.com \nEmilio Huerta HuertaforCongress.com \nNext Slide Previous Slide District 21 in California is 71 percent Latino and overwhelmingly Democratic. Since 2012, it\u2019s elected David Valadao as its representative in Congress.\nAnd that is quite remarkable \u2013 Valadao is a Republican of European descent, the son of Portuguese immigrants. And in his last two congressional races, he beat Latino Democrats.\nNow, as Valadao seeks his third term in Congress, he is facing what could be his most formidable opponent: lawyer and businessman Emilio Huerta, the son of civil rights and labor icon Dolores Huerta.\n\u201cThat whole district is a mystery to everyone who has ever looked at it,\u201d said California State University, Bakersfield political science professor Kent Price. \u201cIt has a Democratic advantage, a Latino advantage. Demographically and politically, you look at it and ask \u2018How is it Republican?\u2019\u201d\nOne key factor in Valadao\u2019s favor is that he is a moderate Republican who speaks highly of immigration, often invoking his own family. And as a dairy farmer, he has been able to speak on an intimate level to both farmers and farmworkers, who form a large part of the very agricultural district.\nAnother reason is because of low voter turnout among Latinos in a mostly agricultural district that is one of the poorest in the country. While Latinos make up 55 percent of the district\u2019s registered voters, the voter turnout among the group is at about 20 percent.\nBut Price, as well as other political experts, believe that Huerta can bring Latinos and others who have sat out past elections out to vote on Nov. 8 \u2013 if he plays his cards right.\nFamous last name \nHuerta, who never before has run for elected office, has a longtime family connection to farmworkers, and has worked in farmworker rights as a lawyer. He has a keen understanding of the district\u2019s agricultural nature and, of course, he has a famous last name.\n\u201cEmilio has done his work in the Central Valley,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe has a little more advantage than other Democrats who have run against David Valadao.\u201d\nCalifornia is clearly a blue state \u2013 political jargon for Democrat-leaning \u2013 with nearly 45 percent of the registered voters identifying as Democrats. About 27 percent are registered Republicans, and 23 percent have no party affiliation.\nCritics accused Valadao of flip-flopping because he initially said he would back the party's presidential nominee, whether that was Donald Trump or not. But over the summer, Valadao said he would not support someone whose rhetoric \u201cdenigrates people based on their ethnicity, religion, or disabilities.\u201d\n\u201cI am disappointed with the divisive rhetoric coming from this presidential election and cannot support either candidate,\u201d the congressman said in the statement released to the press.\nValadao did not respond to interview requests by Fox News Latino.\nFor his part, Huerta is borrowing the grassroots approach that his mother and her fellow labor leader Cesar Chavez used when building their movement for farmworker rights.\n\u201cMy mom and Cesar had house meetings,\u201d Huerta told Fox News Latino. \u201cWe\u2019ve adopted that method. We\u2019re holding house meetings, we talk to the people around the kitchen table, in their backyards, in local parks, in community centers \u2013 wherever we can do it.\u201d\n\"There's no wine and cheese,\" he added.\nThe immigrant and Latino community in the district, Huerta said, feels little connection to politicians, and so they feel little motivation to vote.\n\u201cThe political process has ignored them,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who get up at 4 or 5 a.m. to work, and they work until sundown. The average income for a farmworker family is $20,000 a year. They don\u2019t have the time to figure out what the political process is and how it can benefit them.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s poor quality water , poor quality air,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cA lot of young children suffer bronchial issues. My daughter was born in the district, she\u2019s asthmatic.\u201d\nThen there is the poor educational record.\n\u201cFifty percent or less of high school graduates attend college,\u201d Huerta said. \u201cThe schools have a lack of resources, I have friends who are teachers and they say they don\u2019t even have AP (advanced placement) courses, like the more affluent districts do.\u201d\nSo he is taking the political world to them, Huerta said.\nHe said he had tried to help them through his work as a lawyer, but then decided he could make a bigger difference by running for office.\n\u201cIt was surprising for me to learn that some communities in the district are still facing the poor conditions they were facing in the 60s,\u201d Huerta said, \u201cwhen Cesar Chavez was organizing in those areas.\u201d\n\u201cPower of the incumbency\u201d \nPrice said that Valadao has been able to stay strong in the race by playing it safe and having hefty campaign coffers.\n\u201cHe has played it middle-of-the-road, he\u2019s a fundraising machine,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe has not been aggressive on immigration. He does nothing to offend anyone. Now he has the power of the incumbency.\u201d\nMany thought that Valadao\u2019s 2014 Democratic rival, Amanda Renteria , would give him stiff competition.\nRenteria, who left California for a while, returned in 2013 and announced she was running against Valadao. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) poured $1 million for ads for Renteria. But Renteria lost the race to Valadao by 16 percent. She is now the national political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\u201cEven though Amanda had roots here, she was seen as someone who hadn\u2019t spent much time here, and there\u2019s a very high level of suspicion when an \u2018outsider\u2019 comes in to run,\u201d Price said.\nHuerta, on the other hand, is running an old-fashioned door-to-door campaign, eschewing the kind of large-apparatus assistance that other Democrats received from the DCCC.\nHuerta's mother has made appearances with him on support of her son's campaign, but she has not been a fixture on the trail in the district, spending far more time campaigning for Hillary Clinton around the country.\n\"She was very supportive when I told her I wanted to run,\" Huerta said. \"She's given me a lot of time.

Johnson announced a review of the sites on Aug. 29, shortly after the Justice Department announced the Bureau of Prisons would reduce and ultimately end the use of privately run federal prisons in response to an audit.\nHowever, closing the contracted immigration sites would require an 800 percent expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement capacity, according to ICE.\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a need for these private prisons,\u201d Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, told FoxNews.com, citing ICE\u2019s own numbers in saying they\u2019re arresting \u201cmore than 100,000 criminal illegal immigrants.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cI\u2019ve registered my concerns [with the administration] and I strenuously oppose closing these private facilities.\u201d\nWhile the Obama administration already is moving to end the use of private general-purpose prisons, ending the use of such centers to hold illegal immigrants could have a far bigger impact. While only 10 percent of federal prisoners are in private facilities, about 60 percent of ICE detainees pending deportation procedures are held in contracted facilities. Their population fluctuates, but averages nearly 34,000 per day, according to ICE.\nImmigration rights activists originally asked President Obama in August to close down those detention centers.\nBut there could be another factor at play.\nMatthew Vadum, senior vice president for the Capital Research Center, a think tank that investigates liberal nonprofits, said the push is driven to benefit activists and labor unions.\n\u201cThis will benefit government unions by providing more opportunities for federal workers and expand unions. De-privatizing doesn\u2019t mean shutting down all of these detention centers,\u201d Vadum told FoxNews.com. \u201cSome will be taken over by the government. This is a gift to the labor movement, but first and foremost it\u2019s ideological, based on the de-incarceration movement.\u201d \nAs of August, ICE uses 182 adult detention facilities, only 10 percent of which are federal government-owned. The rest are in contracted facilities, in many cases with local governments such as county jails. \nThis admittedly makes the immigrant centers more complex than the federal prisons, said Jeremy Mohler, spokesman for the liberal group, In The Public Interest, which has long advocated against both private prisons and detention centers. He acknowledged that public employee unions favor closing the centers but said it goes beyond self-interest.\n\u201cFederal employee unions are interested in having public facilities because that means more union employment in the long run and work conditions will be better,\u201d Mohler told FoxNews.com. \u201cIt\u2019s not just self-interest. Unions are interested in not throwing [immigrant] families into torturous situations.\u201d\nIn The Public Interest is a project of the Partnership for Working Families , a coalition of several progressive groups that includes labor unions.\nThe private immigration centers are actually in the interest of the illegal immigrant detainees, contends Gerges Scott, a former deputy secretary for the New Mexico Department of Corrections.\n\u201cIf DHS closes these detention centers, the detainees will be shipped to overcrowded federal centers,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWomen and children, they will be separated, but they will still be in the same facility with dangerous illegal immigrants. As a former corrections official and taxpayer, this is a concern to me.\u201d\nDuring Scott\u2019s time in office from 1999 through 2002, New Mexico was under a federal order to deal with state prison overcrowding and the state legislature was in no mood to build new prisons. So, the state contracted with private prisons, which he said are more accountable and efficient.\n\u201cPrivate prisons have the same standards and guidelines as federal prisons,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThere is a lot more accountability for private prisons. Union workers in public prisons provide a lot of leniency for their employees. In a private prison, a majority are not unionized, so the oversight is very rigid.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union disputes that assessment. The legal group helped conduct a review that found over a two-year period, six of the eight deaths attributable to substandard medical care in the immigration centers were at contract facilities, ACLU staff attorney Carl Takei told FoxNews.com. But, he adds, if the DHS is going to conduct \u201ca meaningful review, it has to tackle ICE\u2019s incarceration policy.\u201d\nThe head of one large private prison operator, GEO Group, Inc., said he welcomes the review.\n\u201cOur public-private partnership has allowed ICE to transfer services from older public jail facilities that did not meet the most up-to-date national standards to GEO\u2019s highly rated, cost-effective facilities,\u201d said George C. Zoley, GEO\u2019s chairman in a statement. \u201cWe are confident that this independent review will show that GEO has provided needed, cost-effective services that have resulted in significantly improved safety outcomes for the men and women in ICE\u2019s care and custody.\u201d\nICE reportedly has had $1.18 billion in contracts with GEO since 2008. Another private firm, Corrections Corp of America, got $689 million in ICE contracts since 2008. Corrections Corps of America did not respond to inquiries from FoxNews.com.", "  ap \nPHOENIX (AP) \u2013   A coalition of civil rights groups agreed to end its challenge of Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law in a deal in which the state issued guidelines on how police officers must enforce the law's most contentious section.\nThe agreement unveiled Thursday ends the last of seven challenges to the law that was criticized for requiring officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally.\nCourts barred enforcement of other sections of the law, but the questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, despite racial profiling concerns raised by critics of the statute.\nThe enforcement guidelines, issued by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich's office, include a requirement that officers document the reasons for their suspicion that a particular person is in the country illegally.\nThe guidelines say local and state officers generally lack the power to detain people for civil immigration violations and forbid officers from prolonging traffic stops and detentions solely for the purpose of verifying a person's immigration status.\nOfficers would have the discretion not to check people's immigration status if doing so prolongs detentions, hinders investigations or isn't practical because of emergencies, the unavailability of backup officers and other factors.\nOpponents of the law said the changes bring accountability to the enforcement of the statute and said the law is now a watered down version of what it once was.\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich emphasized in a statement that the agreement means the questioning requirement remains in the law.\n\"Our goal while negotiating this settlement was to find a common sense solution that protects Arizona taxpayers while helping our great state move forward,\" Brnovich said.\nCecillia Wang, one of the lawyers who pressed the challenge, said the requirement that officers document the reasons for questioning people about their immigration status brings accountability to the law.\n\"It gives us the hook to investigate cases where a cop actually does cross the line,\" Wang said.\nThe law grew out of a movement formed a decade ago over Arizona's frustrations with federal enforcement of the state's border with Mexico. Proponents of toughening enforcement wanted local police officers to break from tradition and start confronting illegal immigration.\nWhen the law was passed in 2010, it touched off a national furor with supporters calling for similar legislation for their own states and detractors calling for an economic boycott of Arizona.\nIn the end, the courts barred enforcement of the law's requirement that immigrants carry registration papers. It also blocked enforcement of a provision aimed at immigrants that prohibited people blocking traffic when offering or seeking day-labor services on streets.\nAs part of the agreement, the state also agreed to pay $1.4 million in attorney fees and other costs to the coalition.\nThe coalition agreed to drop its appeal of a September 2015 lower-court decision that dismissed the coalition's challenge and concluded the law's critics failed to show police would enforce the law differently for Latinos than it would for people of other ethnicities.\nSeveral of Arizona's other immigration laws have been thrown out by the courts in recent years.\nThe state's immigrant smuggling ban was struck down in 2014 after a judge concluded it conflicted with the federal government's immigration powers.\nA voter-approved law that denied bail to immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and charged with certain crimes was thrown by an appeals court that ruled in 2014 that it violated due-process rights by imposing punishment before trial.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "  Fox News Latino WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 04: U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in the Oval Office of the White House on February 4, 2016 in Washington, DC.

General Assembly session in New York next week, the White House said Friday.\nOn the sidelines of the session, Obama has scheduled meetings with the leaders of Iraq, Nigeria and Colombia and plans to promote trade between the U.S. and Africa.\nObama heads to New York on Sunday for the General Assembly session that opens Monday, his eighth and final as president.\nHe plans to sit down Monday with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to discuss progress the country has made countering the Islamic State group, a coming Iraqi military operation to take back the city of Mosul from IS militants, and a brewing humanitarian crisis inside Iraq, said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser.\nDeputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said this week while visiting Baghdad that Iraqi forces aided by the U.S.-led coalition against IS had retaken half the territory that militants once held in the country. He also announced more than $181 million in aid to address a humanitarian crisis that has festered in Iraq as a result of the insurgency.\nDespite a series of major defeats in recent months, IS has maintained its grip on Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. Iraq hopes to launch an operation this year to retake Mosul.\nObama delivers his final address to the yearly gathering of world leaders on Tuesday, and will use the opportunity to \"step back\" and review some of the progress over the past eight years along with \"some of the trends that have been shaping our international order,\" said Rhodes, previewing the trip for reporters.\nThe Syrian conflict continues to confound world leaders, although a recent cease-fire agreement appears to be holding, but Syria has not yet allowed humanitarian aid to flow to the city of Aleppo and other affected areas. Meanwhile, North Korea continues to defy the international community with its recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests.\nObama also plans to meet Tuesday with Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who has held office for just over a year, to talk about continued U.S. support for security and economic changes in the country, as well the government's efforts to counter the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram.\nAt a summit on refugees that the president is hosting, Obama is expected to press more nations to open their borders and help double the number of refugees who are resettled around the world. Mexico, Sweden, Canada, Germany, Jordan and Ethiopia are co-hosting the summit along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\nEurope has shouldered a large portion of the Syrian refugee crisis. Canada welcomed 25,000 Syrian refugees, and the U.S. recently met its goal of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees this year.\nObama will devote a portion of Wednesday, the final day of the General Assembly session, to promoting trade between the U.S. and Africa. He was attending a summit with some 200 American and African CEOs, and African heads of state.\nThe president also plans to meet with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, mainly to discuss a historic peace agreement recently struck between Santos' government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia rebel group to end 52 years of hostilities, the Western Hemisphere's longest-running war.\nThe U.S. supported the peace effort, and the people of Colombia will vote on it a nationwide referendum in early October.\nOn Sunday evening in New York, Obama was headlining a Democratic Party fundraiser.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "\n[ Polls included: Fox News , NYT/CBS News , Quinnipiac University , WaPo/ABC News , and CNN ] \nHILLARY TRIES TO STOP MILLENNIAL MELTDOWN Admitting a serious deficit with millennial voters, Hillary Clinton and her campaign are starting an intense push to win back the bloc that proves so crucial to Barack Obama\u2019s two presidential victories. \nClinton starts today with a speech at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she will talk about free community college and debt-free public universities. But will it be enough? \nPolls show Clinton doing only about half as well with Millennial voters as Obama did. And with 50 days to go until Election Day, it may be time to start getting panicky. \nClinton\u2019s team has already ramped up spending and voter outreach to this group via social media. PACs supporting Clinton have pledged $20 million to reach out to Millennial females while an anti-global warming group is spending $6 million to get Millennials in Pennsylvania to the polls. \nBut, Clinton can\u2019t seem to score above the 50 percent mark with this group. And it\u2019s not because they\u2019re flocking to Trump. National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar notes that many of these voters are flocking to third-party candidates in high numbers. \nIn the GW Battleground poll , 73 percent of Millennials had an unfavorable view of Trump. Yet, in the four-way race Clinton drew just 46 percent of their support meaning that although they highly dislike Trump they\u2019re not drawn to Clinton either. \nMillennials made their mark on politics as part of the Obama coalition in 2008 giving him 66 percent of those under 30-years-old voting for him. Obama did nearly as well in 2012 with 60 percent of support from that same group.

A new Allentown Morning Call/Muhlenberg College poll shows Clinton up 9 points against Donald Trump in the two-way race, and 8 points in the four-way race. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson takes 14 percent of support in Pennsylvania, which is largely responsible for Clinton\u2019s smaller advantage in the four-way race. Clinton is counting on Pennsylvania as one of the, ahem, key swing states to remain in the blue category this cycle. \nAs the WSJ points out , Clinton\u2019s ability to maintain her lead her depends on continuing to overwhelm white, blue-collar voters in the middle and western part of the state with minority and college graduates in the urban and suburban areas. Clinton has deployed numerous resources in the state, most importantly her top surrogates: Bill Clinton , Vice President Joe Biden and, most importantly, President Obama , who campaigned for her in Philadelphia last week.

Look at it maybe like this: If Scott Walker had become the Republican nominee we could trace it back to his successful fight against government unions in Wisconsin. To have won, Walker would have needed to broaden his appeal, but we could still say that provided the core supporters, notoriety, and most importantly, the brand that Walker would have needed. Obviously, we know that didn\u2019t happen for Walker, but with Trump the birther bomb is what set him off and provided the core support and brand that helps him develop a broader winning coalition.

Advertisement ", "By Andrew O'Reilly \n  Fox News Latino (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) \nThere has been much talk this election season about how Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and border security has driven Latino voters away from the GOP.\nBut there is also a growing concern, among both Democrats and Hispanics leaders, that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is ignoring or taking the Hispanic vote for granted.\n\u201cEvery single Latino knows there is an election going on,\u201d Arturo Vargas, the executive director of the NALEO Educational Fund, told Fox News Latino. \u201cClinton\u2019s outreach is very surgical and focuses on only certain states and ignores the vast majority of Latinos in the country.\u201d\nVargas added that a recent poll conducted by NALEO and Latino Decisions found that while a far larger share of registered Hispanic voters than normal have been reached out to this election season, 60 percent of those polled said that they haven\u2019t heard from anyone.\nClinton\u2019s strategy of focusing on specific Latino-heavy states \u2013 like Nevada and Florida \u2013 and on coaxing the growing population of Hispanic millennials to the polls is not broad enough, critics say, complaining that her campaign is late in launching a more traditional, Spanish-language ad campaign in key markets. The Democratic nominee has missed an opportunity, the thinking goes, that was seized on by President Obama's campaign four years ago.\n\u201cThis approach may end up being vindicated on Election Day,\u201d Fernand Amandi, a veteran strategist who led Obama\u2019s media operation for the Hispanic vote in 2012, told the Washington Post . \u201cI just find it to be more risky than replicating what we know worked \u2013 which is the sustained approach that the Obama campaign put in place.\u201d\nClinton\u2019s aides and supporters, however, argue that as the Latino population continues to get younger \u2013 the median age of Hispanics in the U.S. is 27, according to a Pew Research report \u2013 it\u2019s important to use more non-traditional, social media-based ways of communicating with the group beyond knocking on doors and airing TV and radio ads.\n\u201cA lot of it has evolved to include outreach that isn\u2019t obvious to people who are used to doing it old school,\u201d strategist Maria Cardona told the Post. \u201cThe Clinton campaign and the DNC are very strategically focused on Latino millennials.\u201d\nBesides the concern about how this will play out on Election Day for Clinton, Democrats are also worried about the strategy's effect on races down-ballot.\nIn the battle for the U.S. Senate in Florida, incumbent Republican Marco Rubio holds a sizeable lead over Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy among Latino voters. \nWhile Rubio\u2019s Cuban-American heritage surely gives him a boost among Hispanics, a recent poll found that 6 out 10 Latino Floridians feel they don\u2019t know enough about Murphy to hold an opinion of him. Surely, a cause for concern among Democratic leaders in the state.\nIn Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is an unknown to 4 out of 10 Latinos as she vies to unseat Sen. John McCain. \nIn the battle for Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s soon to be vacated Nevada seat, former Democratic Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto leads Rep. Joseph J. Heck among Hispanics by a 58 percent to 24 percent margin. Even so, 38 percent of Latinos say they don\u2019t know enough about her to have an opinion.\nA spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told the Washington Post that the group is working on a streamlined approach in the closing weeks of the campaign season and pointed out that both Cortez Masto and Kirkpatrick are already airing Spanish TV ads.\nDespite the assertions from Democratic leaders that they are making concerted efforts to reach all Latino voters, critics like Vargas say that they have heard that story before.\n\u201cThis is the historical pattern of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the national elections, the vast majority [of Latinos are] ignored because they focus on battleground states.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re not a three-state community, we\u2019re a 50-state community. Latinos are ignored, and there is no real outreach.\u201d\n\nFollow Andrew O'Reilly on Twitter @aoreilly84. \nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino \nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "By Elizabeth Llorente \n  Fox News Latino Jose Quinonez, 2016 MacArthur Fellow, Mission Asset Fund, San Francisco/CA, Monday, Sept. 12, 2016.

Qui\u00f1onez, who runs a San Francisco nonprofit that helps low-income people build a credit history and pay down debt, began life in poverty in Mexico, the son of a mother and father he knew have only briefly.\nHis father, a cattle rancher, was killed when Qui\u00f1onez was 2. His mother died a few years later of lymphoma, which she never received treatment for because of a lack of access to medical resources.\nHis struggles in Mexico and, later, the United States, shaped a resolve to help others going through difficult times.\nThat has led Qui\u00f1onez to do everything from advocating for immigrants when he was a college student to founding in 2007 the Mission Asset Fund, or MAF, which has helped thousands of people establish their creditworthiness with more than $6 million in loans since its inception.\nThe success of MAF has earned Qui\u00f1onez one of the fellowships awarded annually by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation for exceptional \u201coriginality, insight and potential.\u201d\nKnown also as the \u201cgenius award,\u201d the MacArthur fellowship comes with a no-strings-attached gift of $625,000, distributed over five years.\nQui\u00f1onez, 45, who is one of 23 people to receive the award this year, said he still is stunned by receiving the honor.\n\"I\u2019m doing my happy dance,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said to Fox News Latino. \u201cIt\u2019s a high honor. It\u2019s a lot to take in. I\u2019m thrilled that we\u2019re getting this recognition.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a remarkable milestone for anyone but particularly for a man of Qui\u00f1onez\u2019s humble origins, and for a man who arrived in the U.S. in 1980 after an under-the-radar journey across the border when he was just 9 years old and newly orphaned.\n\n\u201cI remember having lots of friends, lots of cousins,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said about his early years in Mexico. \u201cMy mom raised six kids all by herself \u2013 three brothers and three sisters.\u201d\n\u201cShe was a devoted person,\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe had strong faith, she loved us deeply. Even her last day, she was making sure we stayed together. People were coming to see her, saying, \u2018I\u2019ll take this [child],\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019ll take that one.\u2019 She said, \u2018You take one, you take them all.\u201d\nAnd he never felt deprived or disadvantaged during those times.\n\u201cLater in life I realized our situation\u201d was dire, Qui\u00f1onez said.\nHe and his siblings were brought across the border by relatives who wanted them to have a better life than what they had in Mexico.\nQui\u00f1onez and his relatives were among the millions of undocumented immigrants who came out of the shadows through President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\nHe went to the University of California, Davis, and then to Princeton University, where he earned his master\u2019s degree in public affairs.\nQui\u00f1onez had considered being a doctor, recalling his mother\u2019s suffering during her illness, but he was terrible at chemistry and other sciences in school, and realized that he could still help people through community work and non-profit organizations.\nLower-income people, he thought, could get a chance at a better life if they could just become part of the mainstream financial world, but many lacked a credit history.\n\u201cI decided to work against poverty,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said. \u201cI wanted to help give [people] opportunities so they could live out their lives.

Those assumptions lead to bad policies and bad programs.\u201d\nWhat Qui\u00f1onez knew first-hand about the poor was that many are actually quite sophisticated about finances.\n\u201cThey know more about finances than most of us do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey navigate multiple currencies, manage multiple households across different countries. They informally come together to lend money to one another.\u201d\nWith MAF, those so-called \u201clending circles\u201d that are already common in many immigrant communities were duplicated and given a more formal structure, with each person\u2019s financial activity reported to credit bureaus.  \nWhat began with a handful of people in California obtaining a small loan \u2013 free of fees and interest \u2013 has mushroomed into a program covers more than a dozen states.\nMany immigrants have used MAF to start businesses, buy homes or help finance the cost of becoming a naturalized citizen, among other things.\nIn less than a year, many poor people who had no previous credit history were able to get credit scores of 600 or more, and over time \u2013 often in less than one year -- to improve their scores by well over 150 points.\n\u201cWe took their activity and formalized it,\u201d Qui\u00f1onez said, adding that each person was treated with respect in the process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s appreciating the ingenuity that they have, trying to survive and to thrive, instead of assuming, \u2018You guys don\u2019t know anything.\u2019\u201d\nHe added about his clients, \u201cThey\u2019re honorable people.\u201d\nQui\u00f1onez still isn\u2019t sure what he will do with the MacArthur\u2019s cash prize \u2013 he\u2019s still stunned.\nOne of the causes closest to his heart is comprehensive immigration reform. He would like to see others get the opportunities that he and his siblings \u2013 who all became professionals \u2013 had \u201cto unleash their human potential.\u201d\nBut the one thing that he keeps coming back to is a parent who didn\u2019t live to see him get the award.\n\u201cI know my mother is proud,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that she\u2019s always with me.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

Rahami was wanted for questioning in the bombings that rocked the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and the New Jersey shore town of Seaside Park. (Nicolaus Czarnecki/Boston Herald via AP) /The Boston Herald via AP) \nAt least one trip to Pakistan by New York-area bombing suspect Ahmad Khan Rahami raised a red flag when he returned to the United States, prompting border officials to alert the FBI, Fox News has learned. \nA Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to Fox News Friday that Rahami was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in March of 2014 upon his return to the U.S. from a 13-month trip to Pakistan. The FBI was notified about the interview months before Rahami's father told the FBI his son could be involved with terrorism. \nThe FBI told FoxNews.com earlier this week Rahami's father, Mohammad Rahami, later recanted the remark and that investigators had no basis for pursuing an investigation. Related   A page from Rahami's journal,recovered at the location of his arrest on Monday. \nTypically, when someone is flagged like Rahami was, they are given a secondary interview and questioned further. That information obtained from Rahami\u2019s interviews was passed on to the FBI, according to the DHS official. \nThe information was likely sent to the FBI after being gathered by the National Targeting Center, a division of Customs and Border Protection that targets people and goods at all major ports of entry that pose potential risk to the United States. The NTC is credited with capturing failed Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad in 2010 as he was boarding a flight to Dubai from JFK. \nIt is not known what about Rahami might have raised a red flag, but the agency does track individuals who travel to parts of the world where ISIS or Al Qaeda are active. \nQuestions have been raised as to why there was no apparent follow-up by either DHS, which oversees Border Protection, while the FBI is part of the Department of Justice. \n\"What happened here, as was the case with other terrorists who came on the governments radar, like Syed Farook, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and others, is that our immigration system is producing alerts, and providing the opportunity to investigate suspicious people and activity, but the leads are not followed,\u201d Jessica Vaughan, director of policy research for Center for Immigration Studies told FoxNews.com. \u201cThis is partly because our loosely-run immigration policy has flooded the works with too many people to monitor, and too many immigrant enclaves in which bad actors can melt into the background.\u201d Related   \nVaughn adds that the current system perhaps enabled Rahami to fly under the radar. \n\u201cI believe this oversight on the part of the FBI also stems from a policy emanating from the top that denies any connection between our immigration policy and these incidents of terror attacks, and therefore tends to dismiss or underutilize the national security value of immigration tools,\u201d she said. \nRahami, who has family in Afghanistan and married a woman from the region, made at least four trips to the area between 2005 and 2014, according to the The New York Times . \nOther reports surfaced on Friday, which explains what the suspect may have been doing during one of his trips to Pakistan. \nRahami allegedly spent time in a religious seminary in Pakistan that was known to have ties to the Taliban, according to the UK newspaper the Guardian . \nGovernment officials told the paper that Rahami spent three weeks in 2011 at the he Kaan Kuwa Naqshbandi madrassa in Kuchlak, a long-known hub for the Taliban insurgency. The official also said that Rahami also visited other sensitive areas, including Nushki, where former Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansoor was killed during a U.S.-led drone strike. \nFox News Channel\u2019s Bryan Llenas and FoxNews.com\u2019s Malia Zimmerman and Perry Chiaramonte contributed to this story.

The Local Coordination Committees, another monitoring group, said 49 were killed on Saturday alone.\nThe Observatory said the death toll in Aleppo is expected to rise since many wounded people are in critical condition and rescue workers are still digging through the rubble.\nResidents say the latest bombardment is the worst they've seen since rebels captured parts of the city in 2012.\nAn unnamed Syrian military official was quoted by state media on Friday as saying that airstrikes and shelling in Aleppo would continue for an extended period and \"include a ground offensive\" into rebel-held areas.\nThe fall of Handarat to Syrian troops allied with pro-government Palestinian fighters pushes insurgents further away from Castello Road, a main artery leading to rebel-held parts of the city, which is now controlled by the government.\n\"Breaking the siege through the Castello road has become very difficult,\" Yassin Abu Raed, an opposition activist based in Aleppo province, told The Associated Press.\nAn unnamed Syrian military official quoted by state TV confirmed the capture of Handarat, adding that many insurgents were killed. He said experts are removing explosives from the area. The camp, which is almost empty and largely destroyed, has witnessed intense fighting and bombardment in recent years. It has changed hands in the past between government forces and insurgents.\nThe push came as diplomats in New York have failed to salvage a cease-fire that lasted nearly a week, before giving way to what residents and activists say is a new level of violence. The bombing, which began in earnest late Wednesday, has been unprecedented, targeting residential areas, infrastructure and civil defense centers.\nA Western diplomat speaking to a group of journalists in Beirut said that in New York, the impression from meeting with the Russians was that there is no new offensive, but there are been some mixed messages from the ground. He said there had been reports of advances on the ground and some beefing up of the government and allied forces there.\n\"I will say it seems highly improbable that there will be quick defeat of eastern Aleppo,\" the diplomat said, referring to the rebel-held districts. \"The only way to take it is by such monstrous atrocities that it would resonate for generations.\"\n\"It would be absolutely the stuff of myth and history,\" he said.\nLiving conditions in the already-battered eastern districts have meanwhile grown even worse.\nHanaa Singer, UNICEF representative in Syria, said intense attacks damaged the Bab al-Nairab station, which supplies water to some 250,000 people in the rebel-held east.\nSinger said that in retaliation, the Suleiman al-Halabi pumping station, also located in the rebel-held east, was switched off \u2014 cutting water to 1.5 million people in government-held western parts of the city.\n\"Depriving children of water puts them at risk of catastrophic outbreaks of water-borne diseases,\" Singer warned in her statement, released late Friday.", "  STOCKHOLM \u2013   Excluded from the annual Nobel Prize banquet, the anti-immigration and euroskeptic Sweden Democrats will have their own feast this year with likeminded groups from across Europe.\nSweden Democrats spokesman Joakim Wallerstein said Friday that former UKIP leader Nigel Farage will speak at the Nov. 4 \"European Freedom Awards\" at Stockholm's Grand Hotel, where the first Nobel banquet was held in 1901.\nWallerstein said a prize will be presented to an undisclosed former head of state who has worked for independence and against \"supra-nationalism.\"\nThe Nobel Foundation excludes the Sweden Democrats, Sweden's third largest political party, from its prize banquet, because of their far-right origins.\nWallerstein said the alternative banquet is organized by the Initiative for Direct Democracy in Europe, a think tank linked to euroskeptic parties in the European Parliament.", "Published September 25,   livefyre Email Print Sept. 24, 2016: Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, holds her daughter Princess Charlotte as she speaks to her son Prince George as she and her husband Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, arrive in Victoria, British Columbia.

On this visit the royals will visit British Columbia and the Yukon.\nThe kids did not attend the official welcoming ceremony where several thousand people greeted the royal couple at British Columbia's ornate government buildings in the provincial capital of Victoria.\n\"When we were here last time we were married only three months. The warm welcome that you gave us at that important part of our lives meant a lot to us and we've never forgotten it,\" William told the crowd. \"That is why we are so pleased that George and Charlotte can be with us in Canada this time around, beginning their lifetime of friendship with this wonderful country.\"\nThe 44-year-old Trudeau, who also received loud cheers, joked that getting the kids back on the plane could be a challenge after they see Canada's beautiful Pacific Coast.\n\"I know you've visited Canada before.

He accompanied his father, Prince Charles, and his brother Harry in 1998, 11 months after the death of their mother Princess Diana. William recalled being a shy teenager then.

How awesome.\"\nLinda Gunther said it was fine George and Charlotte weren't there. \"They're kids. They're little,\" she said.\nFar from Victoria's marbled halls and manicured lawns, the royal couple will move to Vancouver on Sunday for a visit to the city's gritty Downtown Eastside, a dozen square blocks of poverty and addiction. They'll have tea with residents at Sheway, a support program for pregnant women and new mothers dealing with addiction and other challenges. William's mother Diana was on hand when Sheway's precursor opened in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1991.\nThe royals will then visit an immigrant welcome center where they will meet with a newly arrived refugee family from Syria. More than 30,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in Canada since Trudeau was elected last fall.\nWhile Australia, Jamaica and Barbados have talked about becoming republics, Canada has shown less interest in replacing Queen Elizabeth II as the figurative head of state.

EPSTEIN, The Wall Street Journal Tonight\u2019s presidential debate figures to be one of the most-watched political events in American history. Viewership for the first one-on-one showdown between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump is expected to approach the 80 million who watched Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter in 1980. \nOne-third of voters say the presidential debates will be very important in helping them decide whom to support for president. The nominees likely will never have a larger audience to which they can make the case for themselves as president. \nThe first presidential debate \u2013 and the two that follow Oct. 9 and Oct. 19 \u2013 will probably be typical of the campaign: full of slashing political and personal attacks along with glaring and repeated departures from the truth, particularly from Mr. Trump, who has rarely allowed himself to be governed by restrictions of fact. \nHere\u2019s a look at what the White House hopefuls can do to best help themselves in their 90 minutes before the biggest audiences of their political careers. \nHILLARY CLINTON Talk to the fence-sitters \nThe latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found approximately 20% of likely voters in November are either undecided or leaning toward a third-party candidate. She has to find a way either to pull them into her camp, or keep them from jumping to Mr. Trump. Motivate the base \nIn five of the last six presidential elections, the Democratic candidate has won more votes than the Republican, so it stands to reason that if Mrs. Clinton can just turn out regular Democratic voters, she\u2019ll be fine come Election Day. \nTo do this she has to hit on the issues that matter to today\u2019s Democratic coalition, a multiracial, multicultural, multilingual group with disparate concerns. Expect her to stress her commitment to social justice issues and an overhaul of the U.S. immigration system in particular, and to remind black and Hispanic voters of Mr. Trump\u2019s long history of questioning   place of birth. Keep it about Mr. Trump \nMrs. Clinton is the second least popular major-party presidential nominee in the history of modern polling. Lucky for her, Mr. Trump is No. 1. \nSo while it is important to give Americans something to vote for, Mrs. Clinton has to be careful not to let Mr. Trump redefine himself as someone suburban women and college-educated white can envision as president. Among those swing demographics, Mr. Trump lags far behind what a Republican needs to win a national election. \nThis will entail not just repeating Mr. Trump\u2019s past provocative statements back to him but challenging him in real time on statements he makes that are not true. \nDONALD TRUMP Knock Mrs. Clinton off balance \nMr. Trump\u2019s biggest advantage is his unpredictability \u2014 this is a candidate who bragged about the size of his genitalia during a primary debate. There is nothing that one can definitively say he won\u2019t do on the biggest stage of the campaign. \nAlready we saw this starting over the weekend, when Mr. Trump on Twitter invited Gennifer Flowers, with whom Bill Clinton reportedly had an affair decades ago, to attend the debate as his guest. (On Sunday, Trump running mate Mike Pence and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said she hadn\u2019t been invited.) \nMr. Trump will need an attack that knocks Mrs. Clinton for a loop to win himself some rhetorical space to look like someone Americans can trust to be commander-in-chief and run the federal government. Look like a president \nWhen he was still running Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Paul Manafort liked to say that once Americans saw his candidate as a president he would win the election in a runaway. Well, Mr. Trump been running for president for 15 months and has yet to put together a full week without a distraction from his core message. \nThis debate will be a chance to show that a candidate who has in the past bragged that \u201cit can be smart to be shallow\u201d has a command of policy sufficient to run the federal government. Refreshing a long-cemented image will be a heavy lift, but if Mr. Trump is going to do it he will need to show a discipline and preparedness in the debate that he has not to date. ...", "By Pastor Dimas Salaberrios\n FoxNews.com Email Print (Courtesy of the author)\nTen men walked in front of flowing traffic and formed a wall. Bewildered, an officer turned to me and said, \"Reverend, I don't know what they are doing.\"\nMy concern grew more for the men blocking traffic. They were perilously close to turning cars that could easily hit them. Sensing the mood of the gathered protestors, I began to lead them in prayer, speaking loudly into my speaker system saying, \"The only one who never gets it wrong, and is the Judge of judges, is God. Looting and going to jail is not the way. We want justice, but we also must conduct ourselves respectfully. Trust me, no one gets away with murder, even if they win a case.

On a humid Saturday night when the Charlotte Police Department finally released two disturbing videos chronicling the last moments of Keith Lamont Scott, a night when no one could predict with certainty just what embers those videos might inflame among frustrated protesters, it was The Church in Charlotte which dominated the night and made the peace that was so very needed.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract\nOn a rough night when body cams called into question the police officer\u2019s account that Keith Lamont Scott had pointed his gun at them, and after days of raucous looting and volatile protests, it was the Church that finally dominated the narrative of Charlotte.

One Muslim imam was so overwhelmed by the show of faith that he asked if I could share about the sixth Commandment of Moses: Thou shall not kill.\nI was in awe of what was happening. The Church in Charlotte kept the focus on our belief that the truth would indeed prevail, be it in a local court or in the Highest Court of heaven.\nI am a pastor in the Bronx who regularly works with law enforcement in my community. I find it difficult to share this, but the truth is many African Americans don't feel protected by the police anymore. They have seen men shot while cooperating (Charles Kinsey), walking away (Terence Crutcher), running away (Walter Scott), choked to death (Eric Garner), shot while backing up with their hands down (Keith Lamont Scott), and the list goes on.\nMy nine-year old daughter has expressed that she is scared of the police. When I was 9, I loved the police and saw them as heroes.\nToday, sadly, some police officers routinely behave like police work is set in a video game with African Americans as its main targets.\nWe are in need of serious reform, and new equality and real \u2018threat assessment\u2019 police training. Though one percent of the African-American population could accurately be identified as gang-bangers, the other 99% are not threats to society. I am praying that the small batch of trigger-happy officers infecting police forces throughout this country will be proactively removed from the ranks.\nPeace is returning to the streets of Charlotte.

They have been consulting lawyers, holding meetings, and brainstorming about how they would protect themselves and push their cause in the event of a Trump presidency.\n\u201cAs someone who is beneficiary of DACA, I heard him clearly say that he wants to take away the small protection that I have, the ability to work with dignity,\u201d said Greisa Martinez, a 28-year-old Texas resident who has DACA and is the state advocacy director for United We Dream Action, a group that fights to get Dreamers a path to legal status.\nDACA recipient and immigration activist C\u00e9sar Vargas, who worked on the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, says he is more worried about the people Trump would select for key administration posts that would affect immigrants.\nVargas, who came from Mexico at the age of 5, and made headline four years ago after he passed the New York state bar exam but was prevented from practicing law because of his immigration status. In February, he was sworn in as a lawyer in Brooklyn.\n\u201cA Trump presidency would pose a danger to DACA and all undocumented immigrants,\u201d said Vargas, 32, who is director and a founder of Dream Action Coalition, which advocates for Dreamers.\nNot because of Trump, but because of the people he would appoint to his administration.\n\u201c\u2026 The people who are around him \u2013 [Senator] Jeff Sessions and Kris Kobach \u2013 are hardliners in immigration,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the people a Trump as president would appoint to the [Department of Homeland Security] or the [U.S . Immigration and Customs Enforcement.]\u201d\n(Kris Koback, the Kansas secretary of state, has been an author of many of the strictest immigration measures at the state level, including Arizona's SB 1070. He also helped draft the Texas-led lawsuit that challenges DACA and Obama's other executive actions on immigration.)\nBut critics of Dreamers say they should not hold special privileges \u2013 and should be held to the same standards as every other immigrant in the country illegally.\nVargas is also one of many Dreamers whose DACA is up for renewal in February \u2013 after the country has a new president \u2013 making it subject to a possible elimination if Trump should win the election and act on his vow to do away with it.\n\"The concern over Trump is not theoretical for me and many Dreamers,\" Vargas said.\nIn the undocumented population, which tends to stay under the radar, Dreamers have been bold and some would say provocative in their fight for immigration reform. In the last decade or so, they have become well-organized, thanks in part to their command of social media, which has enhanced their efforts to get their message out and rally support. They have been holding press conferences, speaking at rallies, appearing on news shows \u2013 without hiding their faces or their names.\nMany threw their support behind Sanders, with some of them citing Clinton's checkered record on immigration. Though generally Clinton had supported a more liberal immigration policy, she at times took stances \u2013 such as not supporting driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants, and saying that unaccompanied minors who arrived illegally from Central America should be sent back \u2013 that angered many Dreamers and other immigration activists. \nThe Dreamers' potent movement achieved results. Even more conservative lawmakers began to distinguish between older undocumented immigrants, and Dreamers, who were described often as being here illegally \u201cthrough no fault of their own.\u201d\nMeasures have been introduced, and some passed at state level, giving reprieve just to Dreamers. Obama issued executive orders, in 2012 and in 2014, through a broader initiative, giving them a reprieve from deportation. \nThe latter initiatives, such the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), which gives reprieve to undocumented parents of legal immigrants or U.S. citizens, have been held up in court. But altogether, the initiatives stand to protect some 5 million people.\nDreamers are actively working to encourage Latinos who are eligible to vote to register and get out to the polls in November.\n\u201cFor me, the fight against deportations is a fight for survival and I am here to stay, ready to fight and together with registered voters in our communities,\u201d Alex Ortega, an undocumented young leader from Longmont, Colorado, said in a statement, \u201cready to win.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

(Ruth Fremson/New York Times, Pool, File) (The Associated Press) \nWASHINGTON \u2013 During their eight overlapping years in the U.S. Senate, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were political partners, friendly \u2014 and sometimes less than friendly \u2014 rivals. Both were influential powerbrokers for New York, his home state and her adopted one. \nNow, their political fortunes could be aligning once again. \nIf Clinton wins the White House, Schumer is expected to be her top Democratic partner in the Senate \u2014 with the November election also determining whether he'll be leading a majority or minority. In either case, their relationship would quickly become one of the most important in Washington, a linchpin in Clinton's efforts to garner congressional support for her priorities. \nThe two already speak a few times a month on the presidential race and Senate landscape. They're also eying an agenda for 2017 that includes a sweeping immigration overhaul, an infrastructure package and gun control legislation. \n\"We basically think alike,\" said Schumer, the Brooklyn-accented lawmaker with unfettered enthusiasm for the Senate's often tedious work. \"We have the same legislative approach: Let's reach out to get the other side and not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\" \nThat professed spirit of bipartisanship is hardly reciprocated by Republicans in this election year. To some GOP lawmakers, the only thing as bad as Clinton occupying the White House is the prospect of a Schumer-led Senate at their end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio has wielded that possibility as a warning to voters during his own re-election campaign, saying that even if Republicans win the White House, \"you won't be able to get anything done because Chuck Schumer is blocking it.\" \nWhile Clinton and Schumer are stalwart Democrats, both can be more transactional than ideological. Schumer backed President Barack Obama's signature health care legislation in 2010, then panned the decision to pursue the measure after it damaged Senate Democrats' electoral prospects. Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements as secretary of state, then announced her opposition to the deal when it fell out of favor with her party. \nIn the Senate, their relationship was defined by an only-in-Washington blend of shared interests and personal ambition. \nAfter toiling in the House for nearly two decades, Schumer was eager to expand his national profile as New York's senior senator when Clinton arrived on Capitol Hill. The popular former first lady was instantly the Senate's biggest celebrity, effortlessly garnering the kind of attention the spotlight-seeking Schumer worked doggedly to attain. \nOne former Clinton aide recalled the senators standing together to catch the Senate subway when a group of students from New York approached Clinton to ask for a picture. When a student pressed a camera toward Schumer to ask if he might take the photo, Clinton quickly suggested the students get a picture with both of their state's senators, as the aide swooped in to intercept the camera. \nOn more substantive matters, the senators' staffs worked feverishly to keep each other in the loop on potential areas of disagreement, knowing the New York tabloids in particular were eager for any hint of a rift. Clinton largely deferred to Schumer on judicial issues, an area where he is passionate, while he took a backseat on the national security matters that passed through her Armed Services Committee. \n\"It took us about six months to a year to work things out,\" Schumer said. \"Neither of us is a wallflower.\" \nThey would still clash over seemingly minor issues \u2014 a kerfuffle over the naming of a courthouse in lower Manhattan still lingers in the minds of former aides \u2014 but joined forces when tragedy hit their state on Sept. 11, 2001. Together, they worked the halls of Congress and the White House to secure $20 billion in federal aid for New York. \n\"9/11 was a defining event in their relationship, it was a defining event in their careers,\" said Polly Trottenberg, a former Schumer adviser who currently serves as New York City's transportation commissioner. \"In some funny measure, the fact that the two of them were such a team had an effect on people.\" \nThe senators would occasionally swap strategy over dinner at Hunan Dynasty, Schumer's favorite Chinese restaurant near Capitol Hill \u2014 \"She hated the choice of the restaurant,\" says one former Clinton aide \u2014 but Schumer never became part of Hillary and Bill Clinton's expansive social circle. He did win their admiration when he stuck by her until the bitter end of her failed 2008 presidential campaign, resisting pressure to publicly switch to then-Sen. Barack Obama. \nIn some ways, Clinton's political failures deepened Schumer's respect. He's known to tell colleagues and staff that Clinton \"has had to climb the greasy pole\" \u2014 a colorful compliment about her ability to fight back from adversity and political defeats. \nSchumer allies say the senator sees a more natural partnership with Clinton than he's had with Obama. While Schumer has grown on Obama over the years, the president has struggled to connect with Schumer's passion for the Senate's political maneuvering and has shown little interest in the kind of pressure tactics and horse-trading that can be used to secure votes. \nWhile Obama largely delegated legislative outreach to his staff, aides say Clinton is more likely to call Schumer for suggestions about how she can woo individual lawmakers. \n\"At the level that they're at now, they've been together from the beginning,\" said Sean Sweeney, who has worked for both Schumer and Clinton. \"There's not going to be much of a getting to know each other period.\" \n___ \nFollow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC Advertisement", "When an illegal can do anything they want under the current Dem driven illegal alien policies...what else would anyone expect?", "  Fox News Latino FILE - In this May 1, 2015 file photo, customers eat outside La India Bonita Mexican Restaurant in Kyle, S.D., on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu \nA slowdown in immigration \u2013 including a reverse migration of Mexicans from the United States back to Mexico \u2013 as well as a decline in births among U.S. Latinos has led to an overall slower growth and dispersion of the community, according to a new study.\nLatino population growth \u2013 once the fastest in the nation \u2013 now is topped by that of Asian-Americans. The Asian population growth rate was 3.4 percent from 2007 to 2014, compared to that of Latinos, which was 2.8 percent in that period. The Hispanic growth rate was lower in the most recent years studied, from 2010 to 2014 \u2013 2.4 percent, according to the Pew Research Center study, which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data.\nConsider that in the 1990s, Latino population growth was 5.6 percent annually, declining to 4.4 percent between 2000 and 2007.\nThe growth of Latinos, and their spreading geographically beyond the one-time hubs of Florida, California and Texas, has resulted in the spread of their cultural and even political influence in small towns, suburbs and rural areas across the country.\nIn 2012, 17 states had kindergarten student populations that were at least 20 percent Latino, up from just eight states in 2000, according to the study.\nHispanics' political clout, as a result, has grown in battleground states such as Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and North Carolina, the study noted.\nCounties in the South continued to account for the largest share of the nation's Hispanic population growth \u2014 43 percent between 2007 and 2014. Among the other fastest-growing counties for Latinos were Luzerne County in Pennsylvania, Beadle County in South Dakota, Duchesne County in Utah and Burleigh County in North Dakota.\n\"Latinos are coming to Utah because the government here is doing a lot to create jobs,\" said Rogelio Franco of Entre Latinos \u2013 a Salt Lake City, Utah, advocacy group that works to integrate Hispanics into the state. EntreLatinos was not affiliated with the study.\nWilliam H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, said the reduced growth rate is largely a factor of the economy. A slower economy is influencing families to hold off on having more children, and it's also discouraging migration amid stronger border enforcement, he said.\nKenneth M. Johnson, a senior demographer at the University of New Hampshire's Carsey School of Public Policy, said U.S. Hispanic women between the ages of 20 and 24 have seen a 36 percent decline in birthrates.\n\"That's by far the largest decline of any other group,\" Johnson said.\nDespite slowing population growth, Latinos still accounted for 54 percent of the nation's population growth between 2000 and 2014, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\nRegional growth patterns also have changed some following the economic downturn of 2007 reflecting the changing economies of states, the study found.\nFranco, of Entre Latinos, said he thinks the declining birthrate is a result of Latino millennials holding off on having children while pursuing their education.\n\"They are planning more,\" Franco said. \"They are focusing on other things.\"\nThe growth in North Dakota's statewide Latino population nearly doubled to 18,000, making it the state with the highest Hispanic growth rate over the seven years studied. Though small in numbers compared to states like California and Texas, the rise in Latino residents has put pressures on local governments and non-profit groups to accommodate the new residents.\nFor example, in 2014 Catholic nuns from Mexico were sent to North Dakota to help serve new Hispanic parishioners.\nNorth Dakota had experienced an oil boom until recently, attracting workers from around the country. It remains one of the least diverse states in the nation.\n\"Latino population growth has become less concentrated in counties with historically large Latino populations and whose Latino population grew by at least 10,000,\" the study's authors wrote.\nThough growth has slowed in the last seven years, the Latino population in the South has exploded when examined over 14 years.\nFrom 2000 to 2014, Hispanic populations in Tennessee and South Carolina, for example, nearly tripled.\nNorth Carolina also saw its population spike 136 percent since 2000, the report said.\nMauricio Castro, an organizer with the North Carolina Congress of Latino Organizations, said immigrants coming to the region tend to work in the construction or service industry.\nStill, between 2007 and 2014, nearly 40 counties experienced declines in the percentage of Latinos. Most of those counties were in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas \u2014 states with traditionally large Hispanic populations.\nFrey said once the U.S. economy starts picking up, he expects to see a return of higher rates of immigration and increase births.\n\"This is not the end of Latino growth in the United States by any means,\" Frey said.\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "'What is Aleppo?'

NJ hospital courts Russians for 'birth tourism' Published September 07, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nFor a pregnant woman in Russia, the sales pitch from one New Jersey hospital is alluring: Spend upwards of $10,000 to deliver a baby in a U.S. facility where mother and child will receive superior medical care. \nWithin the fine print is the greatest benefit of all -- American citizenship for the newborn and all the privileges that come with it. \n\"Childbirth in New York is the best investment in the future of your family!\u201d reads the Russian-language AmeriMama website. Related Image Expand / Contract The hospital has aggressively advertised its maternity services in Russia. (Screengrab) \nThe \"AmeriMama\" program at Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center, first reported by NJ Spotlight , is part of a lucrative and controversial business called \"birth tourism,\" the practice of soliciting pregnant women from other countries to deliver their children in the U.S. -- automatically making them American citizens -- before they return home. \nBut the Secaucus, N.J., hospital has taken it to a brazen new level, say immigration experts. \nFor fees ranging from $8,500 to $27,500, the Russian-language website for AmeriMama promised to secure citizenship papers, passports, and travel visas for the baby, according to NJ Spotlight, which reported on the program in August. Related Image Expand / Contract Experts say the hospital may not be breaking the law, but its strategy is brazen. (Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center) \nWhile U.S. \"birthing houses\" and \"maternity hotels\" have been targeted by the feds, an American for-profit hospital openly marketing U.S. citizenship appears to be the first of its kind, according to one government source and watchdog groups. \n\"They claim they\u2019re selling their hospital services, but the unspoken benefit of this is that the child gets a U.S. passport and U.S. citizenship,\" said Jessica Vaughan, of the Center for Immigration Studies. \n\"This is essentially U.S. citizenship up for sale,\" Vaughan told FoxNews.com. \"And this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a hospital itself market to this customer base.\" \nThe AmeriMama website and its Facebook page were removed shortly after NJ Spotlight ran a series of reports last month investigating the hospital's birth-tourism program and questionable business practices. \nHospital officials did not return repeated requests for comment. \nThe laws surrounding birth tourism are murky. It is not illegal for foreign couples to give birth in the U.S., but it is illegal for them to lie to immigration officials about the reasons for their visit. An estimated 40,000 babies are born to couples visiting the U.S. each year. \n\"There is no clear law that prevents hospitals from establishing this business and promoting it abroad and there\u2019s no law against a foreigner coming here for the specific purpose of having a baby,\" said Vaughan. \"It only crosses the line into a violation of law if they are misrepresenting the purpose of their visit or if they were to overstay or if they were to fraudulently claim public benefits.\" \nMany birth tourism cases, Vaughan explained, \"start with a lie to the immigration officer at the point of entry.\" \n\"That\u2019s an immigration violation and means they should be deported,\" she said. \nAlvin Phillips, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said, \"There is nothing in the law that makes it illegal for pregnant women to enter the United States.\" \n\"However, if a pregnant woman or anyone else uses fraud or deception to obtain a visa or gain admission to the United States, that would constitute a criminal act and be a matter of interest to Homeland Security Investigations (HSI),\" he said. \nA booming business, birth tourism appeals to middle and upper- middle class couples in countries such as Russia and China, most of whom return home after the baby is born, though Vaughan noted this is difficult to track. The dual citizenship granted to their baby is considered an insurance policy, should the child choose to return to the U.S. to attend school -- and receive in-state tuition -- or the parents opt to apply for permanent U.S. residency. \nAdding to the controversy, is the potential cost to the U.S. taxpayer. \nShould a complication arise at birth, the bill would far exceed the $28,000 figure reportedly advertised by AmeriMama. \n\"Who pays for that?\" asked Vaughan.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (The Associated Press) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump steps off his plane after arriving for a campaign rally at Germain Arena, Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, in Ft. Myers, Fla. (AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) (The Associated Press) Previous Next \nWASHINGTON \u2013 Bombings in the New York region and a stabbing attack in Minnesota have thrust Islamic extremism into the forefront of the 2016 election just a week before the first presidential debate, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton offering dramatically different visions of how to fight it. \nTrump has embraced aggressive rhetoric in a plan that's short on detail, but centers on limiting immigration \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 and dispensing with \"politically correct\" policies that currently block racial profiling and the use of torture. \nClinton has offered policies that would focus on leveraging alliances and improving relationships with Muslim communities at home while working closely with technology companies to crack down on propaganda and communication that encourages \"lone wolf\" attacks. \nThere are limits, of course, to what the White House can do to prevent extremist attacks at the local level, where local law enforcement remains the first line of defense. Yet the occupant of the Oval Office will have the power to set the course of the nation's approach to fighting the threat of such attacks at home and abroad. \nHere's a look at each candidate's prescription: \n___ \nIMMIGRATION \nTRUMP: His plan to combat illegal immigration \u2014 and reduce legal immigration \u2014 is the centerpiece of his plan to address Islamic extremism. Trump has repeatedly called for a moratorium on accepting Syrian refugees. His position is part of a broader stance on immigrants that has ranged from imposing a complete ban on foreign Muslims entering the United States \"until we know what the hell is going on\" to \"extreme vetting\" and an ideological test for would-be immigrants from regions plagued by Islamic extremism. \nCLINTON: She has said she would expand President Barack Obama's refugee program from accepting 10,000 to about 65,000 Syrian refugees annually. This would be in addition to the tens of thousands of refugees accepted from around the world every year. Clinton says she would continue to use the existing system to vet the background of immigrants and refugees, an effort that can take years to complete. More broadly, she supports creating a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally, so long as they are not violent criminals. \n___ \nFIGHTING THE ISLAMIC STATE ABROAD \nCLINTON: She has said she would not authorize sending ground troops to Syria or Iraq to take on the Islamic State group, instead favoring a plan to intensify the current coalition air-strike campaign. She also would increase diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving Syria's civil war and Iraq's sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shiites, which fueled the group's rise, and has pledged to improve cooperation with European intelligence agencies to halt extremist networks. She has also called for an \"intelligence surge\" that would include Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East and a closer partnership with regional intelligence services. \nTRUMP: He has said repeatedly that he wants to \"bomb the hell out of ISIS.\" Trump spent months on the campaign trail suggesting he had a secret plan to defeat the Islamic State group \u2014 in May, he deemed it a \"foolproof way of winning\" \u2014 but has added he does not want to reveal it because it would tip off extremist leaders. Earlier this month, he instead suggested that, upon his election, he would give generals \"30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS.\" He has said he'd send ground troops to the Middle East to fight the Islamic State group, in addition to the 5,500 there now, but has wavered on how many. \n___ \nDOMESTIC ATTACKS \nTRUMP: He has repeatedly endorsed racial profiling   as a counterterrorism tool. Trump has not released any specifics as to how U.S. law enforcement would use profiling, or how he would require it as president, but said Monday that authorities have no choice but to use racial profiling and noted it is a tool Israel uses to combat Islamic extremists. He said \"politically correct\" policies currently prevent police from keeping Americans safe. The New York billionaire also believes local law enforcement agencies should monitor mosques, saying in June that it should be done \"respectfully.\" \nCLINTON: She wants local law enforcement to develop improved relationships with Muslim community leaders, who she said are best positioned to recognize extremists in their communities. Clinton has argued that racial profiling is generally ineffective and demeaning to the people being profiled. She has promised to boost federal support for local law enforcement, a move she cites as a key to her strategy. And she supports a law that would prohibit people on the terror watch list from being able to purchase firearms. \n___ \nCYBERSECURITY \nTRUMP: He has not articulated a policy for addressing cybersecurity, an area national security officials cite as one of the most significant threats to the nation. Asked by an ally earlier in the month to explain his approach to cybersecurity, Trump said \"cyber is so big\" and later noted it's becoming \"more important.\" On Monday morning, when asked about websites that offer directions on how to build bombs, he said people who post such sites \"should be arrested immediately.\" \nCLINTON: She has called on U.S. technology companies to be more cooperative in countering extremist propaganda, tracking social media patterns and incepting encrypted communications. She supports the creation of a National Commission on Encryption to help tech companies and the government find a balance between privacy and security concerns. Clinton said in an August speech that she would treat a cyberattack from an adversary \"like any other attack\" against the United States. She has called on the government to work with private institutions to protect against cyberattacks from countries like Russia and China, while vowing to modernize the nation's electric grid to address its vulnerabilities. \n___ \nCLASH ON TORTURE \nCLINTON: Clinton has condemned the use of torture as an interrogation technique. During her first presidential run, Clinton briefly suggested that its limited use in extreme circumstances could save lives, but by September 2007 she categorically ruled it out, saying \"it cannot be American policy, period.\" She has also suggested that it doesn't work and, in a March speech at Stanford University, warned that \"it puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk\" by promoting retaliation. \nTRUMP: He has repeatedly come out in favor of using torture. \"What do you think about waterboarding?\" he asked the crowd at a June rally in Ohio. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough.\" He has on other occasions suggested that he would authorize techniques that were \"a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\" Waterboarding, used during the Bush administration on detainees after 9/11, was later outlawed by Congress in a law signed by Obama. \n___ \nCOALITION BUILDING \nTRUMP: He has made \"America First\" a key campaign slogan and has suggested he would pull back on international relationships. Earlier this year, he suggested that he would consider pulling the United States out of NATO, because it was \"obsolete\" and \"costing us a fortune.\" In July, he raised the possibility he would not automatically defend NATO allies unless those nations have \"fulfilled their (financial) obligations to us.\" He also advocated for a stronger ties with Russia, saying \"wouldn't it be nice\" to have warmer relationship with that nation. \nCLINTON: She has pointed to a need to build international coalitions. In a reference to Trump's approach, she warned last month that, \"You don't build a coalition by insulting our friends or acting like a loose cannon.\" She called NATO one of \"the best investments\" the United States has made and has pledged to remain a member of the military alliance. And she has pointed to her coalition-building record as secretary of state, including an 18-month effort to impose sanctions on Iran in an effort to hinder its nuclear programs.

But, over time, she realized that her efforts were worth nothing if she didn't have a Social Security Number, since without that, she couldn't achieve many of her goals, Matuz told EFE.\nBorn in the Mexican state of Sonora, Matuz came to this country when she was just 15 with the aim of reuniting with her mother.\nFacing many obstacles due to her immigration status, Matuz managed to finish high school and continue her college studies, eventually graduating with a degree in electronic engineering from Arizona State University.\nIt was during her university years that she experienced firsthand the true significance of \"not having papers\" and how doors closed and opportunities were denied to undocumented people despite their desire to get ahead and the efforts they made in their studies and careers.\nIn 2007, Arizona approved the controversial State Law 300, which denied undocumented students the possibility of paying for public university or college studies as state residents.\nIn 2009, Matuz began to get involved in the struggle, after noticing the unfair aspects of the system, she said.\nShe co-founded the Arizona Dream Act Coalition and for years was a \"regular face\" at marches, protests and events promoting the Dream Act, Dreamers and the immigrant community in Arizona, fighting hard to prevent the legislation from being approved at the national level.\nHer work in Arizona was recognized in April 2012 when Time listed her as one of the world's most influential people, sharing the honor with leaders and other well-known people such as President Barack Obama.\nMatuz also was one of the group of Dreamers who filed a lawsuit against the state of Arizona when in 2012 then-Gov. Jan Brewer signed an executive order denying driver's licenses to young people protected under the DACA program.\nAfter a long legal struggle, a federal judge finally ruled in favor of the Dreamers in December 2014 and allowed them to obtain driver's licenses.\nOn Monday, the activist was in a group of approximately 140 people from more than 130 countries who took the citizenship oath at a ceremony held in the Trevor Browne High School auditorium in Phoenix.\nMinutes after becoming a citizen, Matuz registered to vote, a process that she completed along with her mother.\nMatuz - who is now married to a U.S. citizen and is the owner of her own real estate company - said she was just practicing what she's been preaching: that everyone who can should register to vote.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "  Democratic Senate candidate Russ Feingold (left) and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. (right) class over immigration policy. (AP Photos) \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2013   Ron Johnson wants to take immigration reform one step at a time. Russ Feingold wants to go all in.\nWisconsin's U.S. Senate candidates' immigration stances couldn't be more diametrically opposed, with each aligning closely to his party's stances. Johnson has become a loud advocate for securing the border first and worrying about those already here later. Feingold, by contast, wants sweeping reforms that include creating ways for people already here illegally to become American citizens.\nJohnson, the incumbent Oshkosh Republican, has been pushing for securing the border since he became chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee last year, echoing what has become a key Republican talking point as the campaign season rolls on.\nIn a report last year, he called the nation's legal immigration system \"horribly broken.\" Comprehensive immigration reform can't happen until the country solves the drivers of illegal immigration -- better wages, the president's unwillingness to turn people away at the border and the U.S. demand for drugs.\nThe federal government instead should tackle the issue in steps, first by securing the border, Johnson said. That's a tough task, since no country's border is 100 percent secure. But Johnson wants to start by gathering better data on illegal border crossings; launching a public relations campaign to keep people off drugs; moving federal agents to crossing hotspots; including shrinking the wage gap between the U.S. and its southern neighbors; and returning unaccompanied minors to their home countries. He's also called for erecting fencing along high-traffic border areas.\nOnce that's done, the nation should turn its attention to people who are already here illegally, Johnson has said.\nThe senator has called for cutting off federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities that don't turn people in the country illegally over to federal authorities. In a 2013 news release, he said he voted against a comprehensive reform bill because it wouldn't do enough to solve illegal immigration, although he has said he supports a path to citizenship and deporting millions of people wouldn't be practical.\nJohnson also has said Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's plan to remove people living in the country illegally if they've committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses is in the country's best interests. He has stopped short of supporting Trump's plan to build a wall along the southern border, though, saying strategic fencing is a better option.\nFeingold, a Democrat looking to reclaim the Senate seat he lost to Johnson in 2010, supports comprehensive reform, including improving border security and providing a path to citizenship for people already in the country. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to propose a route to citizenship within her first 100 days in office. During his tenure in the Senate, Feingold voted twice for the Dream Act, a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally because they were brought to the country as children.\nFeingold also supports President Barack Obama's executive orders that shielded up to 4 million children and parents in the country illegally from deportation. The U.S. Supreme Court blocked the order in June, though Clinton believes such actions are within the president's authority.\nIt's unclear how much immigration policy will resonate with Wisconsin voters. Johnson has been pounding away at border security, bringing it up at multiple forums over the last year, but Feingold has focused largely on other issues such as college affordability and opposing multi-national trade agreements.\nImmigration is a much larger issue in southwestern states than in Wisconsin, said David Canon, chairman of the University of Wisconsin-Madison political science department. But Johnson appears to be spotlighting it in an effort to motivate conservative voters, particularly Trump supporters, and get them to the polls, Canon said.\nJohnson's philosophies have pushed Voces De La Frontera Action, the political arm of the immigrant advocacy group Voces De La Frontera, to endorse Feingold.\n\"(Hispanics) are a growing constituency in Wisconsin and Johnson is motivating them to turn out against him,\" Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces De La Frontera Action, said in a statement.\n ", "What he means is accept more Muslims, whether refugee or not. \nThanks, but no thanks.", "Good for Texas!

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki) \n\u201cNo person shall \u2026 be deprived\nof life, liberty, or property,\nwithout due process of law\u2026\u201d \n- Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nThe clash in American history between liberty and safety is as old as the republic itself. As far back as 1798, notwithstanding the lofty goals and individualistic values of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the same generation -- in some cases the same human beings -- that wrote in the First Amendment that \u201cCongress shall make no law \u2026 abridging the freedom of speech\u201d enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts, which punished speech critical of the government.\nSimilarly, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process has been ignored by those in government charged with enforcing it when they deal with a criminal defendant whom they perceive the public hates or fears. So it should come as no surprise that no sooner had the suspect in the recent New Jersey and New York City bombings been arrested than public calls came to strip him of his rights, send him to Gitmo and extract information from him. This is more Vladimir Putin than James Madison.\nI have often argued that it is in times of fear -- whether generated by outside forces or by the government itself -- when we need to be most vigilant about protecting our liberties. I make this argument because when people are afraid, it is human nature for them to accept curtailment of their liberties -- whether it be speech or travel or privacy or due process -- if they become convinced that the curtailment will keep them safe. But these liberties are natural rights, integral to all rational people and not subject to the government\u2019s whim.\nI can sacrifice my liberties, and you can sacrifice yours, but I cannot sacrifice yours; neither can a majority in Congress sacrifice yours or mine.\nThe idea that sacrificing liberty actually enhances safety enjoys widespread acceptance but is erroneous. The Fort Hood massacre, the Boston Marathon killings, the slaughters in San Bernardino and Orlando, and now the bombings in New Jersey and New York all demonstrate that the loss of liberty does not bring about more safety.\nThe loss of liberty gives folks the false impression that the government is doing something -- anything -- to keep us safe. That impression is a false one because in fact it is making us less safe, since a government intent on monitoring our every move and communication loses sight of the moves and communications of the bad guys. As well, liberty lost is rarely returned. The Patriot Act, which permits federal agents to bypass the courts and issue their own search warrants, has had three sunsets since 2001, only to be re-enacted just prior to the onset of each -- and re-enacted in a more oppressive version, giving the government more power to interfere with liberty, and for a longer period of time each time.\nWe know from the Edward Snowden revelations and the National Security Agency\u2019s own admissions that the NSA has the digital versions -- in real time -- of all telephone calls, text messages and emails made, sent or received in the U.S. So if the right person is under arrest for the bombings last weekend, why didn\u2019t the feds catch this radicalized U.S. citizen and longtime New Jersey resident before he set off his homemade bombs? Because the government suffers from, among other ailments, information overload. It is spread too thin. It is more concerned with gathering everything it can about everyone -- \u201ccollect it all,\u201d one NSA email instructed agents -- than it is with focusing on potential evildoers as the Fourth Amendment requires.\nWhy do we have constitutional guarantees of liberty?\nThe Constitution both establishes the federal government and confines it. It presents intentional obstacles in the path of the government. Without those obstacles, we might be safe from domestic harm, but who would keep us safe from the government? Who would want to live here if we had no meaningful, enforceable guarantees of personal liberties? When our liberties are subject to the needs of the police, we will end up in a police state. What does a police state look like? It looks like the Holocaust and communism.\nEveryone who works in government has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. Hence, it is distressing to hear lawmakers calling for the abolition of due process for certain hateful and hurtful defendants. Due process -- fairness from the government, the right to silence, the right to counsel and the right to a jury trial with the full panoply of constitutional requirements and protections -- is vital to our personal liberties and to our free society as we have known it.\nIf anyone who appears to have been motivated to attack Americans or American values based on some alleged or even proven foreign motivation could be denied the rights guaranteed to him under the Constitution by a government determination before trial, then no one\u2019s rights are safe.\nThe whole purpose of the guarantee of due process is to insulate our liberties from subjective government interference by requiring it in all instances when the government wants life, liberty or property -- hence the clear language of the Fifth Amendment. The star chamber suggested by those who misunderstand the concept of guaranteed rights is reminiscent of what King George III did to the colonists, which was expressly condemned in the Declaration of Independence and which sparked the American Revolution.\nSupreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter once wrote that the history of American freedom is, in no small measure, following fair procedures -- which means enforcing the guarantee of due process. Without due process for those we hate and fear -- even those whose guilt is obvious -- we will all lose our freedoms.\n\nAndrew P.

Florida state Rep. Carlos Trujillo sits to his right. Martin Bermudez \nFresh off the first debate of the general election on Monday, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump appeared before an audience of more than 150 Latino business and political leaders in Miami Tuesday afternoon.\nThe event, held at Miami Dade College, had been postponed twice before, but that did not temper the enthusiasm among the crowd for Trump's candidacy.\nIrina Vilari\u00f1o, who fled Cuba with her family in the early 1980s through the Mariel boatlift, told Fox News Latino that Trump assured the crowd that he understands the struggles of many Hispanics.\n\u201cHe said he sympathized with our sentiments, he knows how we come [here] for freedom, for opportunities,\u201d said Vilari\u00f1o.\nThe 30-minute event kicked off with a tribute to Miami Marlins star pitcher Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez, who died Sunday at the age of 24 along with two of his friends in a boating accident. \n\u201cWhat a talent. What a great person,\u201d Trump said of Fern\u00e1ndez, according to the Miami Herald. \n\u201cI was just talking to Jeff Loria about Jos\u00e9,\u201d he added, referring to the owner of the Marlins. \u201cHe\u2019s devastated.\u201d\nThose in the audience got inside the venue by invitation. Many were Republicans and, more specifically, Trump backers.\nSeveral people were brought on stage to share stories of their family\u2019s arrival in the United States, as well as why they support Trump.\nWhile polls have shown Trump trailing behind Democrat Hillary Clinton among Latino likely voters, some demographic groups, such as Cuban-Americans and Venezuelan-Americans in South Florida, include many among their ranks who favor him.\nAddressing the audience from the stage, where he was joined by Florida state Rep. Carlos Trujillo who acted as emcee, Trump said of Venezuela: \u201cI see the problems. I see them on the news every night.\"\nHe added, \"I\u2019ve got so many friends from Cuba, and they\u2019re so unhappy.\u201d \nIf elected president, he said, referring to U.S.-Cuba policy, \u201cWe\u2019ll make the right deal. We will make the right deal, believe me.\u201d\nMartin S.

Trump had primed people to expect something different, both with his public wobbliness over the last week and his quick-strike into Mexico, where he lucked out in a successful meeting with that country\u2019s hapless president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, and sounded newly statesmanlike notes about pursuing the good of the \u201chemisphere.\u201d\nRead the full story at the New York Post\u2192", "Published September 02, 2016 Fox News Latino Getty Images \nMarco Gutierrez meant to curb the growth of taco trucks, but he instead may have given them a boost.\nGutierrez, the founder of the group Latinos for Trump, tried to defend the Republican presidential candidate\u2019s controversial speech on cracking down on illegal immigration by sounding an alarm \u2014 if left to their own devices, he said, Mexicans here will turn the United States into a country where \u201cyou\u2019re going to have taco trucks on every corner.\u201d\nGutierrez issued his dire warning during an interview with MSNBC host Joy Reid , who responded with a visible look of horror.\nWhat Gutierrez was trying to get across was his belief that Mexicans are overbearing, and leave their imprints on everything, even on people\u2019s palates.\n\u201cMy culture is a very dominant culture,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s imposing and it\u2019s causing problems.

But we also have problems.\u201d\nThe remark spawned a new hashtag #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner, which was among the most popular on Twitter on Friday. The bulk of social media comments poked fun at the taco truck remark, and many people posting them said having a taco truck on every corner would be sublime.\nOn Thursday, Gutierrez issued a similar warning \u2013 this time more generally about a Latino invasion \u2013 on his personal YouTube account. \n\n\"This is what I think about Hispanics because I am one. Our culture is a very dominant culture,\" Gutierrez said while in a car. \"I'm going to talk as [if] I was still Mexican \u2014 if you guys as Americans don't do something about this, us Hispanics are taking over.\"\nTaco truck owners, meanwhile, say they're proud of their growing popularity.\n\"Who wouldn't want The Taco Truck on every corner?,\" asked Jason Scott, CEO and co-founder of The Taco Truck, a New Jersey-based company , in a statement to Fox News Latino. \"Since 2009, we've had the privilege to employ hundreds of hard-working Americans and Mexican-Americans along with serving millions of our authentic tacos to loyal customers.\"\n\"Tacos are just one of many Mexican traditions that have added to the amazing cultural patchwork that makes America great,\" said Scott, clearly playing off Trump's campaign motto \"Make America Great Again.\"\n(On his website, www.thetacotruck.com , Scott explains that he is a New Jersey native who \"didn't grow up eating tacos,\" and instead \"grew up eating Taylor Ham, egg and cheese,\" but \"fell in love with tacos when fly-fishing in Mexico.\")\nMany Latinos expressed disgust over Gutierrez's comments.\nOn the MSNBC segment, New York State Sen.

Getty \nAs hundreds of thousands of opponents of President Nicolas Maduro are expected to flood the streets of Caracas Thursday, the buildup to the protest is turning increasingly tense, with the government planning a counter protest and denying entry to at least six foreign journalists who wanted to cover the rally.\nOne of those journalists is Jim Wyss, the Miami Herald\u2019s Andean bureau chief, who was detained by Venezuelan immigration authorities Wednesday evening and later expelled to Colombia.\nAll is well. On my way home sooner than expected. Venezuelan officials were as professional and kind as possible under circumstances.\n\u2014 Jim Wyss (@jimwyss) September 1, 2016 \nThe Thursday march called the \"taking of Caracas\" aims to pressure electoral authorities to allow a recall referendum against Maduro this year.\nMaduro said Tuesday that his opponents hope violence during the march will pave the way for a coup such as the one that briefly toppled his late predecessor Hugo Chavez in 2002.\n\"If they're coming with coups, ambushes and political violence, the revolutionary will provide an uncommon and overwhelming response,\" Maduro told supporters.\nRather than dampening Venezuelans' enthusiasm, the \"war-like\" rhetoric appears to be energizing the opposition, said Dimitris Pantoulas, a political analyst from Caracas.\n\"The government made a big mistake by throwing fuel onto the flames,\" said Pantoulas.\nAmong those taking part in the march, which organizers are hoping will draw 1 million people, are some 100 members of the piaroa and jiwi indigenous tribes. They arrived in Caracas on Wednesday for the protest, after travelling more than 375 miles  \u2014 by foot, canoe and bus \u2014 from the Amazon rainforest.\n\"We came to see if they'll free the political prisoners,\" said Miguelina Caballero through an interpreter. She was referring to someone from her piaroa tribe who had been jailed for alleged fraud during December's congressional elections, a case the government used to disqualify three indigenous leaders from taking seats in the opposition-controlled legislature.\nBut delivering on its big promises won't be easy for Maduro's opponents.\nThe opposition has staged a half-dozen or so marches this year, some of which ended in clouds of tear gas as hard-core activists clashed with riot police, but posed no major risk to Maduro's grip on power. Even the anti-government protests in 2014 that were blamed for more than 40 deaths failed to rally the huge numbers now sought for Thursday's march by the hard-to-keep together Democratic Unity alliance.\nThe opposition hopes to force electoral authorities widely seen as pro-government to allow a recall vote this year. If Maduro loses, new elections would be held and polls indicate the opposition would win. But if a vote is delayed until after Jan. 10, and Maduro loses, his vice president would finish his term ending in 2019.\nElectoral authorities have yet to set the date for the next stage of the complex process, in which the opposition must collect 4 million signatures over three days, with a referendum vote scheduled only once the signatures are validated.\nThe government plans a counter protest on Thursday, but Pantoulas said authorities will have a tougher time rallying supporters among the poor amid 700 percent inflation blamed for growing hunger and a collapse in wages.\n\"I don't know that the poor will join opposition march, but they're not going to partake in the counter-protest,\" said Pantoulas. \"The fact that the poor barrios won't be supporting Chavismo is enough to damage the government.\"\nAlso invigorating the opposition is a government crackdown.\nAuthorities over the weekend moved a prominent opposition leader, former San Cristobal Mayor Daniel Ceballos, from house arrest back to prison while he awaits trial on civil rebellion charges stemming from the 2014 protests. Authorities said he was plotting to flee and carry out violence during the protests.\nTwo other activists, Yon Goicoechea and Carlos Melo, were also detained this week, with a top socialist leader accusing Goicoechea of carrying explosives.\nThere have been more subtle threats as well. Government workers say they've suffered retaliation for signing petitions seeking Maduro's removal and the opposition-leaning newspaper El Nacional said thugs threw excrement and Molotov cocktails at its building Tuesday.\nThe U.S. State Department accused Maduro of trying to bully Venezuelans from taking part in the march.\nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \n ", "  Fox News Latino 2006 Getty Images \nA Mexican man wanted for allegedly shooting his girlfriend in a Texas hotel in 2014 was arrested earlier this week while trying to illegally re-enter the United States.\nMartin Duque Reyes, 38, was detained by Border Patrol agents near the Eagle Pass border crossing in Texas, where he was discovered to have an active warrant for the August 2014 slaying, a statement by U.S. Customs and Border Protection said .\n\u201cThe apprehension of this individual shows the cooperation among all local, state and federal government entities bringing criminals to justice,\u201d said Acting Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J.

And his son is a member of the U.S. Marine Corps based at Camp Lejeune. All of this, he says, makes national security issues real and personal to him. \nHe says Hillary Clinton, like any president, needs a \"solid partner\" in the White House. He's arguing that Clinton is a president who would have a \"steady demeanor, solid judgment and really thick skin.\" \n___ \n3:00 p.m. \nHillary Clinton says her Republican rival is insulting veterans with his campaign rhetoric. \nThe Democratic presidential nominee questioned Donald Trump's readiness and foreign policy expertise for the White House as she campaigned in Tampa, Florida, Tuesday. She said his presidential bid has been \"one long insult to all those who have worn the uniform.\" \nClinton said that \"a man who is so wrong about our veterans isn't right to serve as commander in chief.\" \nClinton attacked Trump for seemingly contradictory plans to combat ISIS, saying he's both promised to send American ground troops into Syria and let Syria become a free zone for the militants. \nBoth candidates will address national security issues at a forum in New York City scheduled for Wednesday night. \n___ \n2:30 p.m. \nDonald Trump says his Democratic opponent would treat immigrants in the country illegally better than veterans. \nThe Republican presidential nominee attacked Hillary Clinton as he courted veterans Tuesday in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He referenced Clinton and President Barack Obama's policies, saying, \"You have illegal immigrants that she wants and he wants treated better than veterans.\" \nTrump promised he would fix bureaucratic problems in the Veterans Administration. In the meantime, he said veterans waiting for care could go to private doctors or hospitals and the government would pick up the bill. \nTrump and Clinton are aggressively courting veterans this week ahead of a national security forum scheduled for Wednesday evening. \n___ \n1:57 p.m. \nHillary Clinton says that the military officials who have backed her candidacy for president believe she will \"protect our country and our troops.\" \nClinton was asked about a letter signed by 88 retired military officials in support of Donald Trump during a briefing with reporters on her campaign plane Tuesday. She responded, \"I think we're up to 89, but who's counting?\" \nSaid she was proud to have endorsements of military, intelligence and defense officials like retired Gen. John Allen, Mike Morell and Mike Vickers. \nShe said that they \"know they can count on me to be the kind of commander in chief who will protect our country and our troops.\" \nShe added that those same individuals view Trump as \"a danger and a risk.\" \n___ \n1:55 p.m. \nHillary Clinton is blasting Donald Trump for saying that he would have left a G-20 summit in China after a logistical flap over the staircase that President Barack Obama used to depart Air Force One. \nClinton told reporters aboard her campaign plane en route to Florida that Trump's views offer \"yet another strong piece of evidence as to why he should never be anywhere near the White House.\" \nClinton said sometimes these types of logistical dust-ups are \"annoying\" but they're not the reason a president attends these types of meetings. She said Obama made \"exactly the right decision to get off the plane and go to those meetings.\" \nObama got off his presidential plane from a secondary exit after arriving in China. It was viewed as a snub by Chinese officials. Trump said it was a sign of disrespect and he would have left immediately if he had been president. \n___ \n1:10 p.m. \nRepublican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence will return to his old stomping grounds and speak to House Republicans next week. \nPence represented Indiana in the House for 12 years. He left Congress in January 2013 before becoming governor. \nSpeaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders invited Pence to address Republican lawmakers. Ryan spokesman Zack Roday says Pence agreed to speak to them next Tuesday. \nPence will appear less than two months before Election Day. \nTwo months ago, Donald Trump, now the GOP presidential candidate, addressed House and Senate Republicans in separate closed-door meetings. Trump lambasted some GOP critics at those meetings. \nRyan has had a cool relationship with Trump. Ryan called Pence \"a great friend and a true conservative\" and said Pence has \"added tremendous value\" to Trump's campaign. \n___ \n12:45 p.m. \nDonald Trump's campaign spokeswoman says that he had spoken to Florida's attorney general in 2013, but the two never discussed Trump's beleaguered Trump University endeavor. \nHope Hicks made the clarification Tuesday, after Trump said a day earlier that he had never spoken to Pam Bondi about the issue, without providing specifics. \nTrump has distanced himself from an improper $25,000 donation from his personal foundation to a political group supporting Bondi's re-election campaign made as her office was deliberating whether to pursue fraud allegations involving Trump University. \nBondi's spokesman told The Associated Press in June that she personally solicited the 2013 donation from Trump by phone. The Trump Foundation check was received days after Bondi's office told a newspaper it was deliberating whether to join a multi-state lawsuit against Trump University. Charities are barred from supporting political activities. \n___ \n11:10 a.m. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan is discussing what would happen if the House of Representatives had to decide the presidential election. \nRyan was asked about the scenario in an interview Tuesday on WRJN in Racine, Wisconsin. If neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump gets a majority of electoral college votes it would be up to the House to decide \u2014 something that hasn't happened since the 19th century. \nRyan responded that \"I haven't really looked too deep into this because I'm not planning having to do this.\" \nBut he made clear he was knowledgeable about the scenario, explaining that the House would have to pick from the candidates who've received electoral votes, with each state delegation casting one vote. \n___ \n9:45 a.m. \nDonald Trump's campaign has released an open letter from retired military leaders promoting his candidacy. \nThe letter, signed by 88 retired generals and admirals, cites an urgent need for a \"course correction\" in national security. \nThe military leaders write, \"We believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world.\" \nIt continues: \"For this reason, we support Donald Trump's candidacy to be our next commander-in-chief.\" \nDemocrats have pounded Trump on national security and aggressively warned voters that he lacks the temperament to control the world's most powerful military. \nDozens of Republican national security leaders released a letter last month warning that Trump would risk the nation's \"national security and well-being.\" \n___ \n9:35 a.m. \nHillary Clinton is unveiling a new ad appealing to military veterans, aiming to undercut Donald Trump's message on defense. \nThe ad, called \"Sacrifice,\" shows military veterans watching clips of provocative statements by Trump, including his claim to know more about the Islamic State group than military generals and his criticism of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a former prisoner of war. \nIt also shows Trump saying he had sacrificed a lot in comparison to families who have lost loved ones in conflict. \nThe ad is airing on cable and in Ohio, Florida, Iowa, Nevada and Pennsylvania. \nIt comes as Trump and Clinton are set to appear in an MSNBC forum on Wednesday night on national security \n___ \n8:10 a.m. \nDemocratic running mates Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have released their campaign book, which is named after the campaign's slogan, \"Stronger Together.\" \nThe 256-page book, released Tuesday, details their policy proposals, including ideas for economic growth, uniting the American people, and foreign policy and policy. \nA statement from the campaign Tuesday said the introduction, entitled \"Love and Kindness \u2014 And Action\" details Clinton's upbringing and the things \"she learned from her mother's difficult childhood.\" Kaine's introduction, entitled \"Fighting for Right,\" describes his service in Honduras and the inspiration he drew from his father-in law, former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton. \n___ \n7:10 a.m. \nDonald Trump says the Mexican president violated some \"ground rules\" by admitting that the two did actually discuss payment of his proposed border wall between the two countries. \nBut the Republican presidential nominee adds: \"That's ok.\" \nTrump spoke in an interview aired Tuesday on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" He says, \"it was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed, but they know my stance and I know their stance.\" \nTrump made a last minute trip to Mexico last week to meet with President Enrique Pena Nieto. At a joint press conference, Trump told reporters that payment of his proposed border wall was not discussed. \nPena Nieto later tweeted that it was discussed and he \"made it clear\" that Mexico would not pay. \nTrump said, \"See who wins in the end, who will win. A hundred percent, they will pay for the wall.\" \n___ \n7:05 a.m. \nMichelle Obama is preparing for her first campaign appearance for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \nClinton's campaign says the first lady will rally voters behind the former secretary of state during a Sept. 16 event in Northern Virginia. The location was not announced. \nMrs. Obama's task will be to urge all voters, but especially young people, in hotly contested Virginia to support Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine in the Nov. 8 election. \nShe'll also urge people not to miss the state's Oct. 17 deadline to register to vote. \nA few days before Mrs. Obama hits the trail, her husband, President Barack Obama, is scheduled to hold his first solo campaign event for Clinton on Sept. 13 in Philadelphia. \n___ \n3:05 a.m. \nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton are pushing ahead in top presidential battlegrounds with Labor Day behind them. \nTrump, the Republican nominee, is set to campaign in Virginia and North Carolina on Tuesday, two critical states in his path to the presidency. \nClinton, the Democrat, is campaigning in Florida in search of an advantage in the nation's largest swing state. A Clinton victory in Florida would make it virtually impossible for Trump to overcome her advantage in the race for 270 electoral votes. \nThe day before in swing state Ohio, Trump softened his stance on immigration while Clinton blasted Russia for suspected tampering in the U.S. electoral process.

(Photos: Getty Images) \nA prominent Latino conservative who, in the face of criticism from other Latinos, endorsed GOP nominee Donald Trump then recently withdrew that support, defended his decision to give the candidate a chance to win him over.\nAlfonso Aguilar \u2013 a former George W. Bush administration official and president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, which aims to build support among Latinos for conservative policies \u2013 told Fox News Latino that the real estate mogul had signaled that he would soften his stance on immigration.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t na\u00efve\u201d to support Trump, Aguilar said. \u201cIt was a long shot, but we had to try to do it.\u201d\n\u201cThere was a real shot of a pivot,\u201d he added. \u201cIt could have happened, but didn\u2019t at the end.\u201d\nAguilar, who had endorsed Trump after long expressing misgivings about him, withdrew his support after the mogul\u2019s hard line speech on immigration last week. Aguilar says he will not vote for president.\nThe former head of the U.S. Office of Citizenship took a very high profile position in opposition to Trump last year as the billionaire took an increasingly hard line on immigration as he competed against a large field of Republicans for the party nomination.\nBut after the reality TV star became the presumptive GOP nominee, Aguilar attended the Republican National Convention in July with what he stated would be an open mind. There, he announced that he was supporting Trump.\nLast October, Aguilar was part of a coalition of Latino conservative leaders who held a press conference ahead of a Republican debate in Colorado to warn the party that to embrace rhetoric deemed anti-Latino or anti-immigrant would have repercussions among the country\u2019s largest minority electorate.\nThe group singled out Trump for the most criticism.\n\u201cThis group unanimously has decided that Donald Trump is not a candidate who we can support,\u201d said Jerry Natividad, one of the organizers of the meeting.\nAfter the meeting, as other GOP candidates withdrew from the race and Trump grew closer to the nomination, members of the group went in different directions. Former U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin boycotted this year\u2019s GOP convention and has decided to support Hillary Clinton \u2013 the first time, Marin noted, she has endorsed a Democratic presidential nominee.\nLike other disenchanted Latinos, Aguilar weighed voting for other Republicans running for office at various levels of government, but leaving the president spot blank.\n\u201cIt would be a protest vote,\u201d he told Fox New Latino on Wednesday.\nThough the convention took a hard line on immigration, with Trump showcasing relatives of Americans who had been killed by undocumented immigrants and bringing them on stage to share their story, some, like Aguilar, believed he would soften his tone.\nLast month, Trump suggested in a meeting with Latino leaders that he was open to their thoughts about how to handle immigration. In a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump went a step further, expressing sympathy for undocumented immigrants who have been in the United States for 10 years or more, had raised families here and not run into any trouble with police. \nHe suggested that they might deserve a chance to legalize their status by paying fines and back taxes, adding that many people had told him that to deport these immigrants from their families would be harsh.\nBut then, after a lightning trip to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, Trump delivered a decidedly hard line speech on immigration, saying, essentially, that no undocumented immigrant should consider himself or herself spared from deportation.\nAgain, he brought to the stage relatives of Americans who had been killed by undocumented immigrants. Critics blasted Trump for showing a menacing, one-dimensional side of immigration.\nAguilar says he and other Latinos stayed in the fold in order to try to nudge the candidate to move to the center on immigration.\n\u201cI knew it was a risk,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we needed to be part of the process to move him to the center. We needed to try to be part of the conversation.\u201d\nBut then Trump delivered his long-awaited address on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, on Aug. 31, and Aguilar decided that was enough.\n\u201cHe gave a terrible speech, and I withdrew my support,\u201d he told FNL. \u201cAt least I know I tried.\u201d\nAguilar said in no uncertain terms that he will not be joining the Republicans who have announced that they are voting for Clinton. He plans to leave the presidential spot on the ballot blank and vote for Republican candidates down-ticket. He urges other Latinos to go to the polls to vote on Nov. 8, and to do the same.\n\u201cHillary will be disastrous for our country,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the future of the Supreme Court. She would appoint judges who would legislate from the bench. She\u2019s aggressively for abortion on demand. All of that is unacceptable. As a conservative, she is not an option.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) 2010 Getty Images \nPHOENIX (AP) \u2013   The sheriff of metro Phoenix came under new criticism Friday from a political foe for his investigation of President Barack Obama's birth certificate on the same day that Republican nominee Donald Trump relented on his claim that the president wasn't born in the United States.\nSheriff Joe Arpaio has long questioned the president's American citizenship, launching an investigation in 2012 that remained open as late as two months ago. He once sent a sheriff's employee to Hawaii as part of the investigation and earned praise from Trump for his efforts. Arpaio defended the investigation by saying people in the county had requested it.\nHis opponent in the November election attacked Arpaio over the investigation Friday, saying the volunteer posse members who conducted the probe could have been used in other ways that could have actually made the community safer.\n\"Here, he has a resource with a volunteer base and instead of using it for serious public-safety investigations, he is wasting it on nonsense,\" said Democrat Paul Penzone, a retired Phoenix police sergeant.\nArpaio's campaign manager Chad Willems and the sheriff's office didn't respond to requests for comment Friday afternoon.\nThe sheriff has said his volunteers found probable cause that the president's long-form birth certificate was a computer-generated fake and questioned whether a selective service card completed by Obama in 1980 was a forgery. No arrests stemming from the investigation were ever made.\nArpaio initially said no taxpayer money would be spent on the investigation and that it would be funded through donations to the posse. But he later promised to use the donations to reimburse the county for some costs after it was revealed that he had sent a sheriff's employee to Hawaii as part of the case.\nThe sheriff won praise in a 2012 tweet from Trump: \"Congratulations to @RealSheriffJoe on his successful Cold Case Posse investigation which claims @BarackObama's 'birth certificate' is fake\"\nThe sheriff has never backed down from the investigation.\nTwo months ago, he said under oath in an unrelated deposition that the investigation into the birth certificate was ongoing. \"And, by the way, that investigation is not done yet,\" Arpaio testified.\nArpaio has said the investigation was necessary because nearly 250 people tied to an Arizona tea party group raised forgery allegations about Obama's birth record.\nAides to the sheriff tried unsuccessfully to dissuade him from pursuing the investigation as Arpaio was facing a tough re-election campaign in 2012.\nIn the 2014 documentary \"The Joe Show,\" then-Arpaio publicist Lisa Allen told the sheriff that pursuing the investigation he would make him \"look like Bozo the clown.\"\n\"Good, let them call me a kook,\" Arpaio said in the documentary. \"Let them do that. Add that one the list. Then we'll do a commercial on that.\"\nCritics have accused Arpaio of launching the investigation to divert attention from his worsening legal troubles and improve his already impressive campaign fundraising.\nArpaio is facing the toughest campaign in his 23 years in office.\nThree years ago, a federal judge concluded Arpaio's officers had racially profiled Latinos in regular traffic and immigration patrols. The judge asked federal prosecutors to bring a criminal contempt-of-court case against Arpaio for defying an order to stop the patrols.\nArpaio's support from voters has been waning in recent years, but his re-election bid is aided by $11 million in campaign fundraising during this election cycle.

A year later, after graduation, she returned to the Big Apple with a full-time job on Wall Street.\nHowever, she said her dream job was rife with stress and pressure: from the fear of being found out as undocumented immigrant, to long hours in a dog-eat-dog world of finance.\n\u201cThere were times if I got called into the boss\u2019 office unexpectedly and I would think \u2018this is it\u2019,\u201d Arce told Fox News Latino. \"I'm going to lose my job, get deported or sent to a detention center.\"\n\u201cIn some ways having the high pressure environment [of Wall Street] helped me suppress the worries about my immigration status,\u201d she added.\nAfter almost 10 years at Goldman Sachs and a marriage to a U.S. citizen, resulting in her green card and then her citizenship, Arce left Wall Street and began the next chapter of her life \u2013 helping other undocumented people and writing her life story.\nThe rights to Arce\u2019s book have been optioned to America Ferrera\u2019s Take Fountain Productions with plans to develop it into a TV series.

Until we start looking at immigration as a potential solution for those issues, we\u2019re not going to get anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anywhere by deporting 11 million people because what it\u2019s going to do to our economy is disastrous.\u201d\nArce was officially sworn in as an American citizen in August of 2014 and will vote in a presidential election for the first time this year.\n\nRebekah Sager is a writer/editor for Fox News Latino.

Bayona, saw its European premiere _ as part of the Official Selection, but out of competition _ on Tuesday. \nIn the interview, Weaver said she was used to playing strong lead roles, as she was too tall for more conventional love stories. \n\"Part of the reason I've been given these parts is that I'm so tall that people don't give me love stories to do _ or very rarely _ and I'm not playing the girlfriend or the sidekick,\" she said. \n\"I take up so much room that they have to give me an interesting part,\" the triple Academy Award nominee added. \nApart from her legendary portrayal of Ripley, Weaver has played on the silver screen fierce women such as American primatologist Diane Fossey in \"Gorillas in the Mist\" (1988) and an ambitious Wall Street executive in the 1988 rom-com \"Working Girl.\" \n\"Are these women strong? Yes, in many ways they are,\" Weaver said. \n\"I've often played women who were conflicted and very isolated, like Diane Fossey, who lived in Rwanda for many years. At the same time she was a very fragile person, a very vulnerable person,\" she added. \n\"So I don't think that's the whole story when you play a strong woman. Yes, they don't give up, because there's no one to help them, but it's usually a more complicated set of facts than that,\" Weaver concluded. \nThe veteran thespian, who has worked with the likes of Ridley Scott, David Fincher, Peter Weir, Roman Polanski and Ang Lee, has starred in acclaimed films such as \"The Year of Living Dangerously\" (1982), \"Death and the Maiden\" (1994) and \"The Ice Storm\" (1997). \nIt was the \"Alien\" saga, however _ to which she is set to return in Neill Blomkamp's upcoming sequel _ that catapulted Weaver to fame as the first modern female action hero. \n\"I was very fortunate to play a character like Ripley, because she is sort of an everyman character, a realistic person in the world of the future,\" she said in the interview. \n\"Science fiction is one of these genres that I don't think is held in high esteem, and yet it is an area in where people get to imagine life in the future, which I think is very compelling,\" Weaver added. \n\"In America, it's a space where people kind of expect a lot of special effects, or 'transformers' and stuff like that, and it really isn't about that: as Jim Cameron said, it's about what it means to be human.\" \nShe added that this makes Ripley's character still relevant in some way, because \"that future hasn't happened yet; now we're in a world where women would have those jobs, but at that time, she was ahead.\" \nWeaver is set to once again work under Cameron's direction in the upcoming three \"Avatar\" sequels. \nThe daughter of a TV executive and a former British actress, Weaver studied English Literature at Stanford and Acting at the Yale School of Drama, where she coincided with Meryl Streep. \nAsked about why she decided to enter the acting profession, she said: \"I had a very shallow reason, really; I thought it was fun. I didn't know what else to do.\" \n\"I couldn't decide whether I wanted to be a marine biologist or a journalist, or this or that; and I thought, well, I'll just be an actor for a while, and eventually I'll play a role and I'll go 'Oh, that's what I should be doing.'\" \nThat moment, of course, never came, as Weaver has continued being a prominent star in Hollywood ever since \"Alien\" shattered the box office. \n\"It's a great job, because you work all over the world, you meet people from all over the world, and I do believe that what we do, being storytellers, is of service to people.\" \n\"I feel that films are potentially very illuminating, transforming, at least an escape... and I consider it _ whatever its problems _ a great industry,\" she declared. \nThis is the third time Weaver has been to San Sebastian.

It is here that the contradiction at the heart of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d immigration policy lies.  What Mr. Trump failed to mention is that we have 11 million people living without legal status in the United States precisely because there are vanishingly few routes through which they can obtain legal status under current law, but there is significant demand from American employers for their work, and from American communities for their contributions.\nIf we are going to \u201cenforce all of our immigration laws,\u201d which provide no path back to legal status regardless of how good a person is or how long they have lived in the United States, then it does not matter how \u201cfair, just and compassionate\u201d the deportation process is.  At the end of that process, with no path to legal status, families will be torn apart and American communities will be devastated.\nFew people discussing the immigration issue today highlight the law at the root of this current immigration dilemma.  In 1996, shortly after Pete Wilson won reelection as governor of California on a strongly anti-immigration platform, the Republican-controlled Congress passed, and Democratic President Bill Clinton signed, a bill called the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, or IIRIRA.  It is that bill which closed of many of the paths people had been able to use to \u201cget legal\u201d if they had fallen out of status.  It created a \u201cone strike and you are out\u201d rule of deportation for a broad range of nonviolent crimes, and it gave sweeping powers to the immigration agencies to deport and remove suspected undocumented immigrants with only limited legal process.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, a \u201cno tolerance\u201d immigration policy was imposed within the immigration agencies, and local police departments were given the unfunded mandate of enforcing immigration law through 287(g) agreements.  Mr. Trump promises to return to these policies with a vengeance, forgetting that they were ended because police departments wanted them to end due to the damage they did to police-community relations. \n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192 \nIt is no surprise that one of the speakers introducing Mr. Trump was the Maricopa County Sherriff, Joe Arpaio, who was recently referred for criminal prosecution for his disregard of a federal judge\u2019s order to cease the unconstitutional profiling of U.S. citizens and legal residents who are Latino.\nMr. Trump\u2019s speech peddled the fantasy that doubling down on these failed policies will miraculously end crime and unemployment mere months after his election.  Twenty years after IIRIRA was passed, these enforcement-only approaches to immigration control have resulted in more than twice as many people without status (5 million in 1996, 11 million today), and a California completely controlled by the Democratic party.  The National Review recently suggested rebranding this approach as \u201cenforcement first,\u201d doubling down on the enforcement-only approach with the goal of having as many people as possible self-deport before discussing any path to legal status for those who remain.\nThe enforcement-only or enforcement-first approach ignores two fundamental realities:\n1. A majority of Americans support a path to legal status for many of the people presently without one.\n2. Unless immigration law provides both workable paths for legal immigration and credible enforcement against those who do not follow those paths, it will not be sustainable.  At present, our immigration laws fail to provide such workable paths.\nAfter the election, Republicans will have to decide on a path forward with regard to immigration.  \nIf Mr. Trump wins the election, they will be asked to go along with his plans for building a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border, to grant significant additional funding to immigration enforcement agencies, and to federalize local police to assist with enforcement of immigration laws in their communities.\nIf he does not win, there will be an opportunity for us to define a different path forward, one which recognizes that those immigrants Mr. Trump referred to just last week as \u201cgood people\u201d need a path under our laws to legal status and full integration in our communities. We should seize that opportunity to enact laws that resolve the contradiction at the heart of \u201cenforcement only\u201d policies, provide such a path for the \u201cgood people,\u201d and continue the American tradition of welcoming and assimilating immigrants from around the world.\n\nWilliam A.

But young whites tend to trust Trump more on issues related to illegal immigration, including securing the border.\nAmong young people overall, 47 percent say they think Trump would better handle securing the border, 26 percent say Clinton would, and 18 percent say neither would.\nThat's according to a new GenForward survey of adults age 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. There's little division on which candidate would better handle immigrants in the country now without permission, with 39 percent choosing Clinton, 38 percent Trump and 14 percent neither.\nBut on all those questions there are significant divisions based on race and ethnicity.\nAmong young whites, more say that Trump would better handle securing the border than Clinton, by a 57 percent to 19 percent margin, while 49 percent say Trump would deal with immigrants who are currently living in the United States illegally, versus 31 percent for Clinton.\n\"We have issues from ISIS types, also we have a lot of illegal immigrants that are taking away from people and we allow them to take government money,\" said Chase Anderson, 25, of Spokane, Washington, is white and thinks Trump would do better on border security. \"We need to figure out our own stuff.\"\nSignificantly more young Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans say Clinton than Trump would better handle dealing with immigrants who are already in the country illegally. Each of those groups is closely divided on which candidate would better handle securing the border.\nReese Toney, 24, of Glen Allen, Virginia, said he was from a mixed race background, noting that he had Hispanic, Italian and African-American roots and his grandfather was originally from Mexico. Toney said he has not decided who to support, but will not be voting for Trump. On border security he said, \"I have to say Hillary would do a better job than Trump because Trump would just alienate and agitate the countries around us.\"\nTrump has made immigration \u2014 including his plans to build a border wall and deport people in the country illegally\u2014 a central issue of his unconventional presidential bid. Clinton would offer a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally and defend President Barack Obama's executive orders that defer enforcement action against children.\nThe poll was conducted before Trump's latest speech on immigration in Arizona this week, a fiery address that reaffirmed his campaign promise to build a wall along the 1,989-mile southern border and force Mexico to pay for it.\nMost young people oppose deporting all immigrants who are in the country illegally, though that's something nearly half of young whites say they support. Young people across racial and ethnic groups favor creating a pathway to citizenship for otherwise law-abiding immigrants who are currently living in the country illegally. That includes 85 percent of all young people, including about 9 in 10 Asian-Americans and Hispanics, along with more than 8 in 10 whites and African-Americans.\n\"I don't want to make convenient pathways to citizenship for everyone coming across. But we need a broader, more tolerant policy,\" said Clare Selden, 29, of Boston, who is white and plans to vote for Clinton. \"You need a path for people who are working and who work harder than I do.\"\nYoung people overall are also supportive of greater efforts to secure the border, but by smaller margins and with greater division among different racial and ethnic groups. Sixty-one percent of all young adults, including 66 percent of whites, 65 percent of Asian-Americans, and 57 percent of African-Americans, say they support increasing government spending on security and enforcement at U.S. borders. Young Hispanics are nearly evenly divided, with 47 percent in support to 52 percent opposed.\nStill, 69 percent of young people, including majorities from each racial and ethnic group, oppose building a border wall to stop illegal immigration.\n\"I don't think the border needs to be better secured,\" Selden said. \"I don't value that as a goal.\"\nMajorities of young people across racial and ethnic groups say they think immigrants are changing American culture and way of live for the better. That includes 64 percent of young people overall, 59 percent of whites, 63 percent of African-Americans, 76 percent of Asians and 75 percent of Latinos.\n\"I think immigration is the backbone of this country. Everybody came here searching for a better life,\" said Toney.\n___\nThe poll of 1,958 adults age 18-30 was conducted Aug. 1-14 using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population.

Mike Pence's order blocking state agencies from helping their resettlement.\nRefugee assistance groups expect more this year, even as lawyers for the state go before a federal appeals court Sept. 14 to try to have the judge's decision overturned. The judge said Pence's directive \"clearly discriminates\" against refugees from the war-torn country.\nSyrians make up less than 10 percent of the refugees who've been resettled in Indiana since October, according to federal records. They also represent only tiny fraction of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the Obama administration said Aug. 29 had been taken in by the United States under a year-old resettlement program.\nPence tried to halt Indiana's participation in that effort with his November order after the deadly terrorist attacks in Paris, saying he didn't believe the federal government was adequately screening Syrian refugees; the attackers primarily were from France and Belgium.\nHis position on the issue hasn't changed, governor's office spokeswoman Kara Brooks said of Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate. And Trump said Wednesday that he would suspend arrivals from Syria, portraying them as a potential security threat.\nIndianapolis-based Exodus Refugee Immigration diverted one Syrian refugee family to Connecticut days after Pence's order, but says it hasn't encountered any troubles as it has brought nearly 100 Syrians to the state since the federal ruling in February.\n\"It has been overwhelming supportive from the Indianapolis community despite Governor Pence's directive,\" said Cole Varga, executive director of the group.\nThe Pence administration has sought to withhold money to resettlement groups for services such as job training, but hasn't denied a greater amount of federal assistance such as food stamps and health care benefits.\nPence issued a statement after U.S. District Judge Tonya Walton Pratt's Feb. 29 ruling, saying: \"My administration will continue to use every legal means available to suspend this program in Indiana unless and until federal officials take steps to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.\"\nExodus argues that Pence's stance would interfere with its mission of helping refugees.\n\"A state cannot pick and choose -- they are either helping refugees or they're not,\" Varga said.\nAll of the Syrian refugees that Exodus has resettled, along with 40 more handled by Catholic Charities of Indianapolis, are living in Indianapolis or its suburbs. In comparison, about two-thirds more have settled in Chicago, and there are 205 in Erie, Pennsylvania, according to the U.S. State Department's Refugee Processing Center.\nOf the 1,447 total refugees who arrived in Indiana from Oct. 1 to July 31, more than 75 percent were from Myanmar. Refugees from that country have been the most common in Indiana for several years.\nPence specifically asked Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin in December not to have Catholic Charities resettle a Syrian family in Indianapolis. Catholic Charities went ahead, however, and will do so even without state or federal money, archdiocese spokesman Greg Otolski said, noting that families wait two years or more to come to the U.S.\n\"It is one of the critical pieces of what we do to be welcoming to people from across the world who need a safe refuge,\" he said. \"We're going to keep providing that service for families who are really fleeing horrible violence in various parts of the world, not just Syria.\"", "4 P \nNeil\u2019s BACK - and taking on 2016!

The winner will have a strong shot at the presidency in elections expected to hinge on security and the economy. Here's a look at the two men and their rivalry:\nHIGH PROFILE POLITICIANS\nNicolas Sarkozy, 61, was France's president from 2007 until 2012, when he lost to Francois Hollande. He has four children from three marriages, the latest with former top model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. He's counting on his image as a staunch advocate of authority, security and strict immigration policy.\nAlain Juppe, 71, was prime minister from 1995 to 1997 under then-President Jacques Chirac, and foreign minister under Sarkozy between 2011 and 2012. He has three children from two marriages. Juppe emphasizes his experience to present himself as the wise politician France needs when the country is under threat of terror attacks.\nPolls show Juppe is currently enjoying high popularity but Sarkozy, his main competitor out of seven other contenders, is getting closer.\n___\nRELIGION\nSarkozy wants a national law banning the burkini swimwear, arguing he's advocating for gender equality and the country's secular values. He also wants to ban the Islamic headscarf from universities, companies and public buildings. He opposes specific pork-free menus for Muslim and Jewish children to be offered in schools.\nIn France, the Islamic headscarf and all other visible religious signs are already banned in schools and for public servants.\nJuppe is also strictly advocating for France's secular values, yet he is campaigning on the concept of a \"happy identity\" and respect for religious freedom, saying the French should cherish the \"joy of living together.\" He's in favor of the freedom to choose between different menus in schools \u2014 including meat, fish or vegetarian \u2014 with no religious connotations.\nThe debate about the relation between religion and the state, in particular Islam \u2014 the second largest faith in the country \u2014 has been prominent following recent attacks by Islamic extremists in the country.\n___\nIMMIGRATION\nImmigration is considered a key issue in the upcoming election amid the major migrant crisis in Europe and the conservative presidential candidate will compete against far right National Front's Marine Le Pen, who is expected to score high.\nSarkozy calls for a new European immigration policy. He is opposed to grant French citizenship to children born from foreign parents, if they have a criminal record or if their family entered illegally in the country. He proposes to remove the emergency health care that enables migrants to get medical treatment for free.\nJuppe proposes a cap on legal immigration to France, to be decided every year by Parliament.\n___\nLESS PUBLIC SPENDING AND LOWER TAXES\nSarkozy and Juppe have quite similar economic proposals. They both want to substantially reduce public spending, diminish the number of public servants and put an end to France's 35-hour workweek \u2014 a measure they believe has held back France's economic growth since it was adopted in 2000.\nThey also propose a pension reform to gradually delay the age of retirement from 62 to 64, according to Sarkozy, or to 65 according to Juppe. They vow to decrease taxes, especially those paid by businesses.\n___\nLEGAL ISSUES\nA French prosecutor has requested this week that Sarkozy be sent to trial over suspected illegal overspending on his failed 2012 re-election campaign. In a separate case, Sarkozy was handed preliminary charges of corruption and influence-peddling based on information gleaned from phone taps about an alleged bid to get information from a judge ahead of a decision.\nSarkozy has not been convicted of any wrongdoing or gone to trial and legally, nothing prevents him from seeking office.\nJuppe was convicted in 2004 of having taken illegal advantage of public funds \u2014 for the benefit of his party \u2014 while he was head of the conservative party in the 1990s. He served a 14-month suspended jail sentence and was deprived of the right to run for political office for one year.", "  Fox News Latino Getty Images \nThe kindergarten students at Fairview Elementary School in Carthage, Missouri have two teachers in their classrooms.

The three are suspected of membership in a foreign terrorist organization.\nTheir arrests followed raids at refugee homes in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the men had been under observation for months, and that \"there are no indications of concrete attack plans\" at present.\n\"This may have been a sleeper cell,\" he told reporters.\nDe Maiziere said the suspects appear to have made it to Europe through the same channels as two men who blew themselves up outside France's national stadium in November in the Paris attacks claimed by IS.\n\"Everything points to the same smuggling organization as with the Paris attackers having brought these three who were arrested to Germany,\" he said. \"And everything points to the travel documents having come from the same workshop.\"\nProsecutors identified the suspects only as Mahir Al-H., 17, Mohamed A., 26, and Ibrahim M., 18, in keeping with German privacy rules.\nThe three traveled to Germany via Turkey and Greece, the route used by most migrants to Europe last year. Mahir Al-H. joined IS in Raqqa, Syria, earlier last year and received weapons and explosives training, prosecutors said, before he and the other two suspects in October told an IS official responsible for \"operations and attacks outside the IS area\" that they would travel to Europe.\nThe three were provided with passports by IS and were given a \"high four-figure sum\" of cash in U.S. dollars as well as cellphones with a pre-installed communication program, prosecutors said in a statement.\nThe Federal Criminal Police Office said that six locations in two German states were searched Tuesday. It said that, as well as the arrests, \"extensive material\" was seized as evidence.\nThe office noted that the attacks in Paris and Brussels over the past year showed that IS has used the migrant flow to send people to Europe. It said that it knows of more than 400 tips about people among the migrants who might have a terrorist background, but most turned out to be wrong. However, more than 60 investigations were opened.\nIn July, two attacks were carried out in Germany by asylum seekers who arrived over the past two years and claimed by IS. Five people were wounded in an ax rampage on a train near Wuerzburg and 15 in a bombing outside a bar in Ansbach. Both of the attackers were killed.\nThose attacks and two others unrelated to Islamic extremism in the same weeklong period put the country on edge and stoked tensions over the arrival last year of hundreds of thousands of migrants.\nThose tensions have helped the nationalist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party, which won over 20 percent of the vote in a state election in the northeastern region of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Sept. 4.\nTuesday's arrests come days ahead of another state election in Berlin.

He got the licenses from a DPS customer representative identified as Jose A. Ytuarte, the plea deal said.\n\u201cThey would wait until lunch to conduct the transactions so that other DPS clerks would be away,\u201d it said.\nLike many states, in Texas only people residing lawfully in the state are allowed to get driver\u2019s licenses. Foreign nationals are allowed to obtain driver\u2019s licenses during the period of their visas, for which they must show their immigration status. To verify their lawful status, the DPS cross-checks their information with that of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration.\nYtuarte, who is 54, got around the rules by saying, falsely, that undocumented people who were applying were born in the United States, according to the newspaper.\nMistry faces sentencing on Dec. 7, while Ytuarte was already sentenced last week to 18 months in federal prison.\nThe scheme began to unravel after someone tipped off the FBI.\nAnd, according to statements from a prosecutor in court Monday, it appears the agencies still don\u2019t know the full names of all the immigrants who got the licenses.\nThe newspaper said that Mistry\u2019s lawyer, Albert Flores, would not comment except to say that there were no links to terrorists.\nFederal agencies became involved initially out of concern that perhaps terrorists had obtained licenses, which then enabled them to board airplanes and gain access to other things that require proof of lawful presence in the United States.\nSimilar corruption cases have cropped up elsewhere in Texas and the nation, as states have gotten tougher about making sure that people who are not authorized to be in the United States do not obtain driver\u2019s licenses.\nIn July, for instance, Linda Ann Perez, a clerk at the DPS office in San Antonio\u2019s West Side was sentenced to nearly four years in jail for taking $215,000 in bribes in exchange for entering fraudulent information into DPS computers so undocumented immigrants could get driver\u2019s licenses, the newspaper said.\n ", "Remind me why our government is bowing to pressure to allow unaccompanied minors, who are not US citizens, into the country.

As we basically ignore immigration law completely, I guess it would do no good to amend existing law to state that if a gang member's parents entered the US illegally, any child actively involved in criminal gangs has no right to citizenship and will be deported.

But American policy towards refugees, here and abroad, is as divisive as ever and millions of children remain unwilling pawns in civil wars and political games.\nIn a report published in early September, UNICEF estimates that an astounding 50 million children around the world have been uprooted.   In Europe alone, UNICEF has also estimated that nearly 100,000 unaccompanied children applied for asylum. The USA Today reported that in Europe alone, 26,000 unaccompanied children entered Europe.\nAmerican children likely can\u2019t help but see on the news, images of their global counterparts in countries like Syria, Central America, Africa, and elsewhere hungry, alone, and scared.  It would be hard to find someone whose heart didn\u2019t ache when these images flash across the screen.\nWhen civil wars go unresolved, refugee and migrant children may be hurt or killed by violence, lose their parents, may have to flee their homes or countries, risk danger, trafficking and exploitation on their journeys to safety, and will go without education, leaving them vulnerable and susceptible to radical influences. \nWhen civil wars go unresolved, refugee and migrant children may be hurt or killed by violence, lose their parents, may have to flee their homes or countries, risk danger, trafficking and exploitation on their journeys to safety, and will go without education, leaving them vulnerable and susceptible to radical influences.  \nThis is a major humanitarian, economic, and security risk. Republicans and Democrats will disagree on how to handle this situation and the war in Syria, but as individuals we can still help vulnerable children.\nNo matter what your political affiliation, this dire situation should prompt us to act to protect these defenseless children. While both parties may disagree on policy related to resettlement to the United States, the enormity of the child refugee problem can make us begin to question what we -- as individuals -- can actually do. Here are some concrete steps we can all take:\nFirst, our children can take action. They represent important voices for kids their age around the world. \nIn our schools, collecting money to support programs for displaced children run by charities like UNICEF is a great option.  Kids can volunteer with organizations that help to educate about issues facing vulnerable children globally and how they can play a role in advocating for those kids.   \nThey can work with teachers on letter writing campaigns to their elected officials to call attention to the urgent needs of children in the developing world.  \nThis dissemination of knowledge is empowering- educating our children about global citizenship and child rights engages them in an exploration of humanitarian issues and can inspire them to take action to improve their world.\nSecond, as adults, we have the opportunity to push our schools to urge students to learn about the world around them. Naturally some images and topics will be too disturbing, but there is valuable content that can be part of a curriculum. This will not only educate kids but also perhaps lay the groundwork for future action as they grow and mature.  \nThird, policymakers also have a critical role to play. As individuals we should push them to design policies that focus on the needs of vulnerable children globally and address the civil wars that are the pervasive cause of displaced children.\nIt\u2019s time for all of us to do more to protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable children.

Speaking from a prison in the city of Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, he told Dr. Jan Kizilhan that these acts would get him to heaven. \nKizilhan, 49, a German of Kurdish background, is a psychology professor and trauma expert who has worked with trauma victims in Rwanda and Kosovo. He went to Iraq with Michael Blume, minority affairs expert for the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg, to help the victims of ISIS.

He embraced the ethnic cleansing that was intended to rid the region of Christians, Jews, non-Sunni Muslims and Yazidis. \n\u201cI asked Abu Chiad how he could show love for his wife and children and murder people the same day,\u201d Kizilhan said in a phone interview from Stuttgart. \nHe said Chiad showed no remorse as he spoke about making daily trips to a marketplace to behead people and rape Yazidi women, after which he would return home as a loving father and husband. \n\u201cKilling them was like killing a chicken,\u201d Chiad told Kizilhan. \nIn Chiad\u2019s mind, Kizilhan said, the victims were not human. He said ISIS killers and rapists rationalize their behavior by dehumanizing their victims, much as the Nazis justified their mass slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust. He has written a book, \u201cThe Psychology of ISIS,\u201d in which he analyzes this savage behavior. It will be published in Germany in October. \nKizilhan had horrifying stories to tell about the 1,100 women and children, former ISIS captives, who are now being treated in Germany, most of them at a facility near Stuttgart in Baden-Wurttenberg. \nRinda, 10, and her mother were abducted on Aug. 3, 2014, when ISIS invaded the Sinjar region. They were taken to Raqqa. Rinda was sold eight times to ISIS fighters, who beat and raped her. Her parents\u2019 fate is not known. \nYasmin, 16, who feared another rape, wanted to make herself undesirable, so she doused herself with gasoline and lit a match. Badly burned, she is in a German hospital facing more than 20 surgeries. \n\u201cNow she looks like a zombie, and children cry when they see her,\u201d Kizilhan said. \u201cIt is so difficult to see what the fire did to her.\u201d \nMost of the 400,000 Yazidis who lived in Sinjar have been displaced, captured or killed. According to a United Nations report, 5,000 Yazidi civilians were murdered in 2014, and women and children were sold into slavery. Many of the abuse victims have committed suicide. \nDuzen Tekkal, a German-Yazidi journalist, went to Iraq to make a documentary \u2014 \u201cHawar\u201d \u2014 about the plight of the Yazidi people. She went because people told her: \u201cYou are a Yazidi and a journalist and must come here and tell the world our story.\u201d \n\u201cI knew it was very dangerous,\u201d Tekkal said in a phone interview. \u201cBut I knew I had to go there.\u201d \nLike Kizilhan, she has difficult stories to tell. She speaks of children who are no longer children. \u201cIn one case,\u201d she said, \u201cA 9-year-old said, \u2018Take me to be raped, not my little sister, please don\u2019t touch her, take me,\u2019 So they took the 6-year-old down the mountain, and they raped her.\u201d \nTekkal said that many of the children repressed their rapes as a defense mechanism. \u201cOne 12-year-old said she wasn\u2019t raped. But she was pregnant.\u201d \nTekkal praised the work Kizilhan is doing. \u201cWe need hundreds of Dr. Kizilhans to deal with all the wounds inflicted by ISIS,\u201d she said. \nKizilhan said Rinda often asks how ISIS can do such terrible things, how people can be so evil. \n\u201cI ask the same question,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is humanity still so evil in the 21st century?\u201d \nDonald Snyder was a news producer at NBC for 27 years and has been a freelance writer since his retirement.

", "By Adam Shaw \n    \nThe Obama administration hit its goal this week of admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees -- yet only a fraction of a percent are Christians, stoking criticism that officials are not doing enough to address their plight in the Middle East. \nOf the 10,801 refugees accepted in fiscal 2016 from the war-torn country, 56 are Christians, or .5 percent.\nReligious Breakdown of Recent Syrian Refugees | Graphiq A total of 10,722 were Muslims, and 17 were Yazidis. \nThe numbers are disproportionate to the Christian population in Syria, estimated last year by the U.S. government to make up roughly 10 percent of the population. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011, it is estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million Christians have fled the country, while many have been targeted and slaughtered by the Islamic State.\nIn March, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. had determined that ISIS has committed genocide against minority religious groups, including Christians and Yazidis.\n\u201cIn my judgment, Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in territory under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,\u201d Kerry said at the State Department, using an alternative Arabic name for the group.\nHe also accused ISIS of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \"ethnic cleansing.\"\nYet, despite the strong words, relatively few from those minority groups have been brought into the United States. A State Department spokesperson told FoxNews.com that religion was only one of many factors used in determining a refugee\u2019s eligibility to enter the United States.\nCritics blasted the administration for not making religion a more important factor, as the U.S. government has prioritized religious minorities in the past in other cases.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointingly disproportional,\u201d Matthew Clark, senior counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), told FoxNews.com. \u201c[The Obama administration has] not prioritized Christians and it appears they have actually deprioritized them, put them back of the line and made them an afterthought.\u201d\n\u201cThis is de facto discrimination and a gross injustice,\u201d said Nina Shea, director of the Hudson Institute\u2019s Center for Religious Freedom.\nExperts say another reason for the lack of Christians in the make-up of the refugees is the make-up of the camps. Christians in the main United Nations refugee camp in Jordan are subject to persecution, they say, and so flee the camps, meaning they are not included in the refugees referred to the U.S. by the U.N.\n\u201cThe Christians don\u2019t reside in those camps because it is too dangerous,\u201d Shea said. \u201cThey are preyed upon by other residents from the Sunni community and there is infiltration by ISIS and criminal gangs.\u201d\n\u201cThey are raped, abducted into slavery and they are abducted for ransom. It is extremely dangerous, there is not a single Christian in the Jordanian camps for Syrian refugees,\u201d Shea said.\nHowever, Kristin Wright, director of advocacy for Open Doors USA \u2013 a group that advocates for Christians living in dangerous areas across the world \u2013 told FoxNews.com that another reason is many Christians are choosing to stick it out in Syria, or going instead to urban areas for now.\n\u201cMany have fled to urban areas instead of the camps, so they may be living in Beirut instead of living in a broader camp, meaning many are not registering as refugees,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThey may still come to the U.S. but may come through another immigration pathway.\u201d\nHowever, others called on the Obama administration, in light of its genocide declaration, to do more to assist Christians, including setting up safe zones in Syria or actively seeking out Christians via the use of contractors to bring them to safety.\nIn March, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced legislation that would give special priority to refugees who were members of persecuted religious minorities in Syria.\n\u201cWe must not only recognize what's happening as genocide, but also take action to relieve it,\" Cotton said.\n\u201cThe administration did the right thing by recognizing genocide, but by not taking action, it deflates it and makes it so Christians and others are not receiving any help,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSo it\u2019s all words and no actions, it\u2019s just lip service on the issue of the genocide.\u201d\nThis week, the ACLJ filed a lawsuit against the State Department for not responding to Freedom of Information Act requests about what the administration is doing to combat the genocide. \nFor Shea, the question is not just about helping refugees, but the very survival of Christianity in the 2,000-year community that has existed since the apostolic era of Christianity.\n\"This Christian community is dying,\" she said. \"I fear that there will be no Christians left when the dust settles.\"\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

And they have done it in ways as varied as working with refugees, studying the forces that led to the attacks and pursuing a parent's unrealized pro-sports dream.\nHere are some of their stories.\n__\n\"I THOUGHT, 'WHAT WAS IT WE SHARED THE MOST?' AND IT WAS WRESTLING\" \nThea Trinidad's pulse thumped as she walked out on the floor of Madison Square Garden as part of pro wrestler Adam Rose's entourage in 2014. It was the first time she'd been there in her own wrestling career. And the first time since she'd been there with her dad.\nLooking up at the seats where they always sat \"was like a punch to the heart,\" she says.\nShe was 10 when she overheard her father calling her mother to say goodbye from the trade center's north tower, where he worked as a telecommunications analyst. Growing up, she pondered how to honor him.\n\"I thought: 'What was it we shared the most?' And it was wrestling,\" she recalls.\nMichael Trinidad was a former high school wrestler who didn't flinch when his tomboy daughter did leaping moves off the furniture. In fact, \"he'd say, 'No, you're doing it wrong \u2014 let me show you,'\" says Thea, 25, who lives in Tampa, Florida.\nAt first, the 5-foot-tall wrestler didn't let on about her dad as she backflipped and body-slammed under the monikers Divina Fly and Rosita. (She now uses her own name). She didn't want anyone thinking she was making a play for sympathy.\nAfter her story emerged, Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine named her Inspirational Wrestler of the Year in 2011.\nShe says she feels her father's spirit every time she goes into the ring.\n\"This one's for you, Dad,\" she tells herself. \"Protect me out there.\"\n__\n\"THINGS KIND OF COME FULL CIRCLE\" \nIt's Lindsay Weinberg's job to find and notify families whose loved ones have died, sometimes under violent circumstances. It's a job she's particularly prepared to do.\n\"I'm giving them among the worst news they can receive, and I've received it,\" she says.\nWeinberg was 12 when the New York City medical examiner's office, where she now works, told her family in 2002 that it had identified her father's remains among the victims of 9/11.\n\"It adds to the amount of empathy that I can have,\" says the 26-year-old, whose father, Steven Weinberg, was an accounting manager killed at the World Trade Center.\nAfter recognizing how forensic science helped provide answers for her family, Lindsay got a master's degree in it, and is now an outreach investigator. She hasn't worked on the continuing analysis of the more than 21,000 bits of bone found at ground zero.\nShe says her connection to 9/11 is \"not something that I lead with, personally or professionally.\" But working at the medical examiner's office, she says, shows \"how things kind of come full circle.\"\n___\n \n\"POSITIVE, PERSONAL GROWTH OUT OF SOMETHING THAT WAS SO HORRIFIC\" \nSeveral years after 9/11, Michael Massaroli came across a plastic bin filled with condolence messages.\nThey had come from people around the country and world, many of them strangers, after the attacks killed his father and namesake, an investment executive. Michael was 6. His widowed mother had just given birth to a baby girl two months earlier.\n\"Hearing how people were so selfless and so caring to us really made me want to try to do something, career-wise, that I thought would help other people,\" he says.\nHe decided that would be public service, since he was already interested in politics. By high school, he was interning for a state assemblyman.\nNow 21 and newly graduated from George Washington University, he got his first job working at a Washington firm that helps political campaigns handle their finances properly. He sees himself eventually working in government as an adviser or aide.\n\"I really try and at least get positive personal growth out of something that was so horrific,\" he says, \"rather than let it break me down.\"\n___\n\"THE LOVE AND THE HERITAGE COMES THROUGH\"\nAnjunelly Jean-Pierre once had her future all figured out. She planned on joining the military and eventually becoming the doctor or lawyer her mother envisioned.\nThen her mother, Maxima Jean-Pierre, was killed at the World Trade Center, where the immigrant from the Dominican Republic managed an executive cafe.\nOver the next few years, Anjunelly grieved, regrouped and decided she wanted to do what her mother did. Recalling the Sunday dinners that filled the house with friends and family, \"I saw how food brings people together,\" says Anjunelly, 34.\nAfter culinary school and a stint as a sous-chef for an Emeril Lagasse TV show, Anjunelly now works in a setting where bringing people together is perhaps especially important: She is a manager in the Members' Dining Room in Congress.\nLast September, a letter she wrote about Maxima was entered into the Congressional Record.

She soaked up books about the forces and failures that led to Sept. 11. She took four years of Arabic in college, got a master's degree in international relations and aspired to work in intelligence.\n\"Being as affected as I was by the geopolitical landscape and my dad being killed on 9/11,\" she says, \"I wanted to make sure it never happened again.\"\nIt was her first day of high school when her father, stockbroker Victor Wald, was killed at the World Trade Center.\nHis daughter, who goes by Alex, was already interested in world events. But 9/11 made her want \"to be that person to decipher that information, to protect the homeland.\"\nNow 28, she works on a cybersecurity project for a contractor for the federal General Services Administration in Washington.\nStudying for her career \u2014 with help from the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund, set up for the children of 9/11 victims \u2014 also meant dealing with the frustration of contemplating missed opportunities to disrupt the terror plot.\nWhen the anger stirred, she'd think of some advice her father gave her a few weeks before the attacks.\n\"You can't look back with regret,\" he told her. And \"never say, 'What if?'\"\n___\n\"ONCE IT'S ON MY SKIN, I HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT\" \nIt's all right to ask Ryan McGowan about the \"IX.XI\" tattooed on the back of her neck. It's 9/11 in Roman numerals.\n\"Once it's on my skin,\" she says, \"I have to talk about it.\"\nRyan was 5, sister Casey 4, when their mother, investment executive Stacey Sennas McGowan, was killed at the trade center.\nAs a preteen, Ryan partly played the role of parent, helping her sister pick outfits for school and making dinner when their father, Tom, had to work. She came to think of her mother as \"an amazing guardian angel.\"\nNow 20, Ryan is a junior majoring in marketing at Boston College, where 19-year-old Casey is a sophomore in communications.\nOften, Ryan makes her way through the campus to a labyrinth inscribed with her mom's name and those of 21 fellow BC graduates killed in 9/11. It's a place she feels close to her mother, whose remains were never identified and buried.\n\"I can just sit there and reflect,\" she says. \"I don't have that anywhere else.\"\n___\n\"I WANTED TO PLAY IN HONOR OF MY DAD\" \nRonald Milam Jr. doesn't always tell his football and basketball teammates that there's a reason he wears the number 33. It's for his father, Army Maj. Ronald Milam, who was 33 when he was killed at the Pentagon on 9/11.\nRonald Jr. never met his father. His mother, then-Air Force Capt. Jacqueline Milam, was pregnant with him on 9/11. She safely escaped from the Pentagon.\nRonald Jr., now a 14-year-old high school freshman in San Antonio, is one of the more than 100 Sept. 11 victims' children who were born after the attacks.\nHe has his dad's features and unflappable personality. And his jersey number was a connection he could make with his father, a college player himself.\n\"I wanted to play in honor of my dad,\" he says. \"So I picked that.\"\n___\n\"I RECOGNIZED HARDSHIP IN OTHER PEOPLE'S LIFE\" \nSometimes, after refugees told her their stories of conflict and loss, Sonia Shah would let them know that she had one, too.\nExplaining that her father died in 9/11 opened \"a bonding moment,\" says the Baylor University social work student, who spent the summer volunteering with refugee aid organizations in Greece.\nHer father, Jayesh \"Jay\" Shah, was killed at ground zero, where he was a financial trading technology executive. Sonia was 7.\nHis death fueled Sonia's impulse to try to help where others turn away.\n\"Because I had faced loss at such a young age and in such a different way than many other people, I recognized hardship in other people's life a lot more easily,\" says the 22-year-old senior, who took a year off from college for religious study.

You are the heroes of today's sport. You have the opportunity to make the world a better place. Hope always defeats fear and we are all part of one world\", said Craven.\nAfter this the president of Brazil, Michel Temer, declared open the Paralympic Games.\nCreated by three directors, the designer Fred Gelli, the writer Marcelo Rubens Paiva and the artist Vik Muniz, the ceremony aimed to reflect the human condition of athletes, their feelings, difficulties and their solidarity.\nOne of the stars of the ceremony was the American athlete Amy Purdy, a Paralympic medalist in snowboarding in the Sochi 2014 Winter Paralympics. Purdy, who lost both legs when she was 19 years old, performed a Samba dance.\nThe most emotional moment of the ceremony came near the end with the lighting of the Paralympic cauldron. Having traveled across the five regions of Brazil over seven days with 500 carriers, the flame arrived at the stadium in the hands of four Brazilian athletes with disabilities: Antonio Delfino, Marcia Malsar, Adria Rocha and Clodoaldo Silva.\nClodoaldo was in charge of carrying the torch to the cauldron, where he had to overcome three slopes with the additional difficulty of wet surfaces from earlier rain.\nReflecting the four Paralympic values: courage, determination, inspiration and equality, the colorful quadrangular torch did not burn out and gave way to the final show.\nSeu Jorge, who was in charge of wrapping up the ceremony, was accompanied by musicians Circle Samba and made the Maracana audience move their bodies.\nThe Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro has participants from 159 countries and 4,432 athletes who will compete in 22 categories, two more categories than in the London 2012 Paralympics due to the inclusion of triathlon and canoeing.", "Jeh Johnson another one of Obama's home boys appointed because he's a Black Democrat.

Castro has announced he is stepping down after 49 years in power, saying he is no longer healthy enough to hold office. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) 2008 Getty Images \nMIAMI (AP) \u2013 Francis Suarez comes from a long line of civic and political leaders who have formed the Republican bedrock in south Florida's Cuban community for a half-century. Yet the 38-year-old Miami city commissioner hasn't decided whether he will vote for his party's presidential nominee. \nAnd he's not alone. Many Cuban-Americans express solidarity with other Latin-Americans who see Donald Trump as anti-Hispanic. Still others hear in Trump's nationalistic populism echoes of the government strongmen they once fled. \n\"There are aspects of Trump that appeal to parts of the Cuban-American culture: strong leadership, the ability and willingness to say bold things,\" says Suarez, the son of a former Miami mayor and a potential chief executive himself. The concern, Suarez says, comes when Trump's boorishness, bullying and slapdash policy pronouncements \"cross the line from bold to wild, unpredictable.\" \nHow those misgivings influence the votes of hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans could tilt the nation's most populous presidential battleground state and, depending on circumstances elsewhere, determine whether Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton wins the election. \nRoberto Rodriguez Tejera, a well-known Spanish-language radio and television host in Miami, says he won't endorse Trump or Clinton, arguing neither has engaged in genuine, personal outreach to average Cuban and other Hispanic voters. But Tejera asks his audiences to compare Trump's assertions that \"I am your voice\" and \"I alone can solve\" societal ills to the initial appeals of authoritarian rulers like Cuba's Fidel Castro and the late Hugo Chavez in Venezuela. \n\"It goes well beyond immigration to the very nature of our Latin-American problem,\" Tejera said in an interview. \"Many of us remember how it starts. It starts with questioning institutions. Then you destroy institutions \u2014 you being the only person in the world who can save the nation from collapse.\" \nFernand Amandi, a Democratic south Florida pollster, estimates the Cuban-American vote could approach 8 percent of the 8 million-plus ballots cast in Florida in November. Amandi said Cuban-Americans are \"the only Hispanic group in the country\" to support Trump over Clinton in preference polling, but not by a margin victorious Republican nominees have managed. \nTrump aides note support from some elected officials and volunteers within the Cuban-American community, but Trump adviser Karen Giorno said his strategy ultimately considers Cuban-Americans as it does anyone else: \"They are worried about safety and security. They are worried about the economy. They are worried about drugs on the street. They are worried about the same things other Americans are worried about.\" \nSuarez, the Miami commissioner, applauds that approach, but he says it doesn't account for some Cubans-Americans who are thinking of themselves, for the first time in presidential politics, as aligned with immigrants from Mexico and the nations of Central and South America \u2014 a collective class of people who have never enjoyed Cubans' favored immigration status. \n\"Some Cubans don't consider themselves Hispanic,\" says Amandi, the Democratic pollster. But now, says Republican pollster Dario Moreno, Trump has made immigration a \"symbolic issue\" that penetrates the Cuban psyche. \"Anti-immigration rhetoric is taken as anti-Hispanic,\" Moreno said, \"and you see that even among the old Cubans\" who were the first to arrive in Florida as refugees after Castro came to power in 1959. \nClinton certainly sees an opening. In the last week, she launched an advertising blitz featuring the endorsement of Carlos Gutierrez, a Cuban-American Republican and commerce secretary for President George W. Bush. Speaking in Spanish, Gutierrez calls Trump dangerous and says: \"For me, it's country first, and then party.\" \nOne of the GOP's top financiers, health-care billionaire Mike Fernandez, recently called Trump an \"abysmally unfit candidate\" and endorsed Clinton. \nOther prominent Republicans \u2014 Miami Mayor Tomas Regalado and U.S. Reps. Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen \u2014 have said they will not support Trump, though they've stopped short of endorsing Clinton. \nTejera, the broadcaster, says heavyweights like Gutierrez and Fernandez \"won't move one vote,\" but their public backing of a Democratic nominee is a striking development in Cuban-American politics. \nFor decades, the equation was simple: U.S. politicians of all persuasions blasted the Castro government and supported the trade embargo first imposed under President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Despite mostly bipartisan agreement, initial Cuban arrivals to the U.S. aligned overwhelmingly with Republicans, largely out of anger at Kennedy's handling of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion intended to topple Castro in 1961. Yet many in that generation have died or are old, and their children and grandchildren, along with more recent Cuban immigrants, aren't as hard line or simply don't vote exclusively on \"the Cuba question.\" \n\"We're starting to see them think and vote like everybody else, not be driven by a single issue,\" says Moreno, the Republican pollster and a professor at Miami's Florida International University. \nExit polls in the 2012 election found Cuban-Americans essentially split between President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney, less than a decade after George W. Bush won the Cuban vote overwhelmingly. Obama has since normalized diplomatic relations with Havana, traveled to the island for a state visit and called on Congress to lift the trade embargo. \nClinton has forcefully ratified Obama's stance. Until last week, Trump effectively endorsed it, as well, with vague qualifiers that he'd get \"a better deal\" than Obama. Yet on Friday in Miami, he reversed himself, embracing the hard-liners' longstanding views and promising to roll back Obama's actions unless the Castro government expanded political freedoms on the island. \nRudy Fernandez, 43, who spent almost a decade working at the Republican National Committee and in the White House under George W. Bush, doesn't mention Cuba when explaining why he will choose between Clinton and Libertarian Gary Johnson. Rather, he argues that Trump has been \"deeply divisive\" and adds a common GOP establishment critique that the billionaire \"is not a Republican ... not a conservative\" and \"lacks the temperament required for the job.\" \nTo be clear, Clinton doesn't have a lock on Cuban-American votes Trump may lose. Amandi notes that Clinton's Spanish-language media presence began months later than Obama's general election efforts. \nTejera dismissed Clinton's south Florida outreach as \"meeting with the usual Democratic officials and donors\" and perhaps the highest-profile Republicans who can't abide Trump. \nThen there's Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's re-election campaign. Moreno described Rubio, the son of Cuban refugees, as a \"role model in the Cuban-American community the way Barack Obama is in the African-American community.\" Rubio trounced Trump in Miami-Dade County in the March presidential primary, despite Trump's easy statewide win. \nBrian Ballard, a top Florida lobbyist in Tallahassee and a Trump fundraiser, predicted Rubio will attract Cuban-Americans who will then vote for Trump, even though he mocked the senator earlier this year as \"Little Marco.\" \nBack at Miami City Hall, Suarez says that's possible, but he argued Cuban-American Republicans are just as likely to see Rubio as an easy out: They can abandon Trump and still call themselves party loyalists, like always. \n\"A presidential election of this magnitude,\" Suarez said, \"the electorate is going to make up its mind all on its own.\" \nLike us on Facebook ", "Vote for Trump because:\n\nSupreme court\n2nd amendment\nImmigration\n\nThe rest is all noise.", "AP-NORC Poll: Most in US frustrated over presidential race Published September 26, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nWASHINGTON \u2013 Carol Jones knows what she wants to hear Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump discuss during their first televised debate: education and jobs.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. \nIn their first face-off just weeks before one of them becomes U.S. president, GOP nominee Donald Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton sparred over trade agreements, with Trump frequently assailing U.S. companies that have taken production to Mexico.\n\nIn Monday's debate, held at Hofstra University in New York, Trump blamed Clinton for what he says have been \"defective\" trade agreements that have cost American jobs.\n\nTrump said Mexico taxes American products imported there, but the U.S. does not tax Mexican imports.\n\n\u201cOur jobs are fleeing the country, they\u2019re going to Mexico. Thousands of jobs are leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us\u2026We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and firing the American people.\u201d\n\nHe says Clinton's been \"doing this for 30 years,\" a reference to her long career on the American political scene.\n\nClinton responded that she held jobs, such as senator from New York and secretary of state, that did not give her a primary role in crafting trade agreements.\n\nTrump also criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was approved under President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton's husband.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has said that 1994 deal had a \"relatively small\" impact on the U.S. economy.\nFor Clinton and Trump, the first of three debates was a crucial chance to boost their standing with voters who view both candidates negatively.\n\nThe televised face-off was the most hotly anticipated moment in an election campaign that has been both historic and unpredictable.\nWhile immigration has been a focus of Trump\u2019s campaign, the candidates were not asked about it by moderator Lester Holt of NBC.\nTrump remarked that the union of immigration agents had endorsed him.\n\"It\u2019s surprising that immigration was totally absent from today\u2019s debate given that it\u2019s one of the only issues that Trump has offered policy options and they are very different from Secretary Clinton\u2019s,\" said Angela Kelley, senior vice president of the Center for American Progress, to Fox News Latino. \"I hope that immigration gets time at the next debate.\"\nClinton emphatically accused Trump of purposely keeping his personal tax returns and business dealings secret from voters, declaring during the debate, \"There's something he's hiding.\"\n\nTrump aggressively tried to turn the openness questions around on Clinton, who is seen by many voters as secretive. Trump said he would release his tax information when she produces more than 30,000 emails that were deleted from the personal internet server she used as secretary of state.\n\nThe Republican has repeatedly said he can't release his taxes because he is under a routine audit.\nTax experts have said there is no reason the businessman cannot not make his tax records public during an audit.\n\nClinton was contrite in addressing her controversial email use, saying simply that it was a \"mistake.\" She notably did not fall back on many of the excuses she has often used for failing to use a government email during her four years as secretary of state.\n\n\"If I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently,\" she said.\nTrump countered, \"That was more than a mistake.\"\nClinton also cast Trump as sexist, saying: \"One of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.\u201d\nReferring to former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, Clinton said Trump had called the former beauty queen \"Miss Piggy\" and \"Miss Housekeeping\" because she is Latina.\nMachado, who was born in Venezuela, recently became a U.S. citizen.\n\u201cAnd you can bet she\u2019s going to vote this November,\" Clinton said.\nClinton was measured and restrained as Trump repeatedly spoke over her and tried to interrupt her. A businessman and political novice, Trump continuously cast her as a \"typical politician.\"\nThe 90-minute televised debate came six weeks before Election Day and with early voting already getting underway in some states. Despite Clinton's advantages, including a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation and a favorable electoral map, the race is exceedingly close.\n\nThe candidates also tangled over taxes and how to bring good-paying jobs back to the United States.\nDemocrat Clinton said her Republican rival was promoting a \"Trumped-up\" version of trickle-down economics \u2014 a philosophy focused on tax cuts for the wealthy. She called for increasing the federal minimum wage, spending more on infrastructure projects and guaranteeing equal pay for women.\n\nThe candidates' families filed into the debate hall at New York's Hofstra University moments before Clinton and Trump took the stage. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, shook hands before taking their seats.\n\nClinton aides spent the days leading up to the debate appealing for the media and voters to hold Trump to a higher standard than they believe he has faced for much of the campaign. Their concern is that if the sometimes-bombastic Trump manages to keep his cool onstage, he'll be rewarded \u2014 even if he fails to flesh out policy specifics or doesn't tell the truth about his record and past statements.\n\nTrump's campaign has accused Clinton of trying to pre-determine the outcome and said their concerns reflected worries about the Democrat's debating skills.\n\nClinton, a former senator and secretary of state, is banking on voters seeing her as a steady hand who can build on the record of President Barack Obama, whose popularity is rising as he winds down his second term in office. She's called for expanding Obama's executive orders if Congress won't pass legislation to overhaul the nation's immigration system and for broader gun control measures. Overseas, she's called for a no-fly zone in Syria but has vowed to keep the military out of a large-scale ground war to defeat the Islamic State group.\n\nFor Clinton, victory in November largely hinges on rallying the same young and diverse coalition that elected Obama but has yet to fully embrace her.\n\nTrump has tapped into deep anxieties among some Americans, particularly white, working-class voters who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying nation. While the real estate mogul lacks the experience Americans have traditionally sought in a commander in chief, he's banking on frustration with career politicians and disdain for Clinton to push him over the top on Election Day.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Here's a thought.

It is true that he provided a bit more detail in the ten points he recited before a git crowd in Arizona than he has listed on his website since last fall but most of the additional detail came in the form of a chorus of talking points from anti-immigration hardline groups. \nHis policy proposals were a wish-list of the \u201cenforcement only\u201d approach that has been tried, and failed, for the past twenty years.

I am so glad to be back in Arizona, a state that has a very special place in my heart. \nI love the people of Arizona and, together, we are going to win the White House in November. \nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox. \nTonight is not going to be a normal rally speech. \nInstead, I am going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today: immigration. \nI have just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico \u2013 a man I like and respect very much, and a man who truly loves his country. Just like I am a man who loves the United States. \nWe agreed on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business. \nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the close friendship between our two nations. \nIt was a thoughtful and substantive conversation. This is the first of what I expect will be many conversations in a Trump Administration about creating a new relationship between our two countries. \nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington. There is no other way. \nThe truth is, our immigration system is worse than anyone realizes. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them, the politicians won't talk about them, and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up. \nToday you will get the truth. \nThe fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians. Let me tell you who it doesn't serve: it doesn't serve you, the American people. \nWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, and lower wages. \nImmigration reform should mean something else entirely: it should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens. \nBut if we are going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and sensitive issues. \nFor instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills, and living conditions. These are valid concerns, expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds. \nWe also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. It is our right as a sovereign nation to choose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish here. \nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws. \nI have met with many of the parents who lost their children to Sanctuary Cities and open borders. They will be joining me on the stage later today. \nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration. This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered federal custody, and then was released into a U.S. community under the policies of this White House. \nHe was released again after the crime, and is now at large. \nSarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top of her class, the day before. \nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa, Arizona. He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody. \nAnother victim is Kate Steinle, gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times. \nThen there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administration's priorities for removal. \nIn California, a 64 year-old Air Force Veteran, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions, but was never deported. \nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names. \nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years, we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher. \nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower-skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they will ever pay in. \nBut these facts are never reported. \nInstead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing, and only this one thing: the needs of people living here illegally. \nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants \u2013 or however many there may be. \nThat has never been the central issue. It will never be the central issue. \nAnyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington. \nOnly out of touch media elites think the biggest problem facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. \nTo all the politicians, donors and special interests, hear these words from me today: there is only one core issue in the immigration debate and it is this: the well-being of the American people. Nothing even comes a close second. \nHillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated. But she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable death. \nNo, she's only talking about families who came here in violation of the law. \nWe will treat everyone living or residing in our country with dignity. We will be fair, just and compassionate to all. But our greatest compassion must be for American citizens. \nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders. President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention \u2013 and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty. \nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants \u2013 breaking the federal budget. On top of that, she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, especially African-American and Hispanic workers. This includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees in a four-year term. \nNow that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan \u2013 about which she has not answered a single substantive question \u2013 let me tell you about my plan. \nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from federal immigration officers, along with top immigration experts who represent workers, not corporations. I also worked with lawmakers who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, and most importantly, I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. \nNumber One: We will build a wall along the Southern Border. \nOn day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable physical wall on the southern border. We will use the best technology, including above-and below-ground sensors, towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels, and keep out the criminal cartels, and Mexico will pay for the wall. \nNumber Two: End Catch-And-Release \nUnder my Administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country. \nNumber Three: Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. \nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country. We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement. \nBeyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice. But their days on the run will soon be over. They go out, and they go out fast. \nMoving forward, we will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings. We will terminate the Obama Administration's deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets. \nSince 2013 alone, the Obama Administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S. communities \u2013 these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who not detained or processed for deportation. \nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens. \nWe will restore the highly successful Secure Communities program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails. Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this Administration. This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. \nOn my first day in office, I am also going to ask Congress to pass \"Kate's Law\" \u2013 named for Kate Steinle \u2013 to ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry face receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. \nAnother reform I am proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, two law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously-deported illegal immigrant. The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly identified and removed. \nWe are going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers. Within ICE, I am going to create a new special Deportation Task Force, focused on identifying and removing quickly the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice. \nThe local police know who every one of these criminals are. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years. And now, finally, we will turn the tables and law enforcement will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess. \nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, and put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks. We will expand the number of Border Patrol Stations. \nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. The endorsement I've received from the Border Patrol officers means more to me than I can say. \nNumber Four: Block Funding For Sanctuary Cities \nWe will end the Sanctuary Cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities. \nNumber Five: Cancel Unconstitutional Executive Orders & Enforce All Immigration Laws \nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants. \nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs \u2013 including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. \nClinton's plan would trigger a Constitutional Crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. \nIn a Trump Administration, all immigration laws will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement \u2013 and ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs. Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation \u2013 that is what it means to have laws and to have a country. \nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges \u2013 that is, those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net, along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under the current Administration. \nNumber Six: We Are Going To Suspend The Issuance Of Visas To Any Place Where Adequate Screening Cannot Occur \nAccording to data provided to the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign-born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. The number is likely higher, but the Administration refuses to provide this information to Congress. \nAs soon as I enter office, I am going to ask the Department of State, Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put into place. \nCountries from which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. \nFor the price of resettling 1 refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. \nAnother reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include an ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people. \nFor instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 in these two countries, according to Pew research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. \nApplicants will be asked for their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities, attitudes on Radical Islam, and many other topics as part of the vetting procedure. \nNumber Seven: We will ensure that other countries take their people back when we order them deported \nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they have been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. Due to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into U.S. communities. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet, despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries, Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. \nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home. \nAccording to a report from the Boston Globe, from the year 2008 through 2014, nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not take them back. Many of these 13,000 releases occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch \u2013 she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didn't do it. \nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assault and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable, who went on to reoffend at a very high rate. \nNumber Eight: We will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system. \nFor years, Congress has required a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system, but it has never been completed. \nIn my Administration, we will ensure that this system is in place at all land, air, and sea ports. Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never left. Beyond violating our laws, visa overstays pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system should be a high priority and \"would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in August and September 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the U.S. on expired visas.\" \nLast year alone, nearly a half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing visa overstays will be a top priority of my Administration. If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never leave \u2013 the Obama-Clinton policy \u2013 then we have a completely open border. We must send the message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced. \nNumber Nine: We will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet. \nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country. \nImmigration law doesn't exist just for the purpose of keeping out criminals. It exists to protect all aspects of American life \u2013 the worksite, the welfare office, the education system and much else. That is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforce the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. \nI will enforce all of our immigration laws. \nThe same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants used some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs, like food stamps or housing assistance. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the U.S. treasury. \nThose who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for removal. \nNumber 10: We will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers \nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. \nMany of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. But we now have an obligation to them, and to their children, to control future immigration \u2013 as we have following previous immigration waves \u2013 to ensure assimilation, integration and upward mobility. \nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. \nThe time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals: \nTo keep immigration levels, measured by population share, within historical norms to select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society, and their ability to be financially self-sufficient. We need a system that serves our needs \u2013 remember, it's America First. To choose immigrants based on merit, skill and proficiency and to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally and properly-vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. \nWe've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. To avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on autopilot for decades, so why should we do the same for immigration? \nLet's talk about the big picture \nThese ten steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last fifty years. \nBecause I am not a politician, because I am not beholden to any special interest, I will get this done for you and your family. \nWe will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, and when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down, border crossings will plummet, gangs will disappear, and welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our inner cities. \nFor those here today illegally who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to enter under the immigration caps or limits that will be established. \nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. There will be no amnesty. \nOur message to the world will be this: you cannot obtain legal status, or become a citizen of the United States, by illegally entering our country. \nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays. \nPeople will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down, and wait to be legalized. Those days are over. \nIn several years, when we have accomplished all of our enforcement goals \u2013 and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, and the establishment of our new lawful immigration system \u2013 then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those who remain. That discussion can only take place in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time. \nRight now, however, we are in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis, and a terrorism crisis. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time. \nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas, or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing \u2013 and the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security. \nThese are matters of life-and-death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. \nWhat we do know, despite the total lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. The result will be millions more illegal immigrants, thousands more violent crimes, and total chaos and lawlessness. \nThis election is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration, and reform our laws to make your life better. \nThis is it. We won't get another opportunity \u2013 it will be too late. \nSo I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for \u2013 and who we are fighting for. \nSo I am going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. \n[[PAUSE FOR ANGEL MOMS \u2013 EACH SAYS THE NAME OF THEIR CHILD INTO THE MICROPHONE]] \nNow is the time for these voices to be heard. \nNow is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. \nNow is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans. \nLet's fix this problem. \nLet's stop the drugs and the crime. \nLet's protect our Social Security and Medicare. \nAnd let's get unemployed Americans off of welfare and back to work in their own country. \nTogether, we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. \nTogether, we can save America itself. \nJoin me in this mission to Make America Great Again. \nThank you, and God Bless you all! From the Channel", "By Julie Roginsky \nPublished September 01, 2016 FoxNews.com     \nIn the span of a few hours on Wednesday, Donald Trump taught Mexico a lesson that domestic observers of his temperament have learned long ago: a foolish consistency is not only the hobgoblin of little minds but also the hobgoblin of would-be world leaders who refuse to deliver one message in private, only to double down on a self-defeating policy in public to feed the ravenous beast that is his base.\nIn Donald Trump\u2019s world, bands of illegal immigrants are roaming our streets, killing our children, raping our women, changing the very culture of what made America great at some undisclosed moment in history.  Only a police state and a big, beautiful wall paid for by a foreign government can stop them.\nWhen Trump had an opportunity Wednesday to discuss payment for the wall with the man leading the nation that would presumably pay for it, he choked. I\nn order to burnish his statesman bona fides, he did not stare down Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at their meeting on what is arguably his most famous campaign plank: Mexican payment for a multi-billion dollar wall to stem the hoards of criminal foreigners coming here to lessen America\u2019s greatness.\nIf Trump\u2019s speech in Phoenix was designed to bring more Latinos into his coalition, his dark rhetoric about undocumented workers and continued insistence on splitting up families will not move the needle.\nAlso apparently not on the discussion docket between Trump and Pena Nieto: the location of the wall and whether it would be built in the middle of the Rio Grande, which delineates much of the border boundary between the United States and Mexico, or whether the United States intends to invade Mexico to build the wall on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. (Presumably, part of making America great again does not involve building a wall on our side of the Rio Grande and cutting off American access to an important water source.)\nA few hours later, a much more loquacious Trump touched down on the northern side of the Rio Grande to deliver a speech that at once doubled down on his dystopian vision of immigration and provided a response to Pena Nieto, who claimed shortly after Trump\u2019s departure that he had told him explicitly that Mexico would not pay for the wall.\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192 \nThe speech tried to thread the needle between placating Trump\u2019s primary base, which was promised a deportation force that would remove millions of undocumented workers from the country on day one of a Trump presidency, and the reality-based community, which has a sizeable say in the outcome of this year\u2019s election.  \nTrump doubled down on his pledge to deport those who committed crimes, although he did not specify whether those crimes included those who received something as minor as a traffic ticket. \nHe doubled down on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 suggestion that illegal immigrants self-deport back to their home countries if they wanted to return legally, without specifying exactly how he would encourage them to do that in light of their previous refusal to take Romney up on his offer.\nHe even doubled down on his insistence that Mexico pay for the wall, immediately overshadowing whatever presidential vibes he had been trying to emit as he stood at a podium next to a head of state in Mexico City hours earlier.\nIf Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico was designed to reassure voters that he could be a statesman, his failure to get on the same page as Peno Nieto about whether payment for the wall had been discussed at their meeting showed that he was not ready for prime time.\nIf Trump\u2019s speech in Phoenix was designed to bring more Latinos into his coalition, his dark rhetoric about undocumented workers and continued insistence on splitting up families will not move the needle.\nIf Trump\u2019s entire exercise of the last twenty-four hours was to reassure his primary base that he was not wavering on an issue that is so crucial to them, he accomplished his mission. But it need not have taken a trip south of the border and a speech in ever-more-purple Arizona to convince them that he shares their views, even if those views are so out of step with what the vast majority of American voters support.\n\nJulie Roginsky has extensive experience in government, politics and public relations on both the federal and state levels.

Jeff Flake. \"Donald Trump has managed to make this an interesting state in terms of presidential politics, and not in the way that Republicans have wanted.\"\nJohnson \"is an easy out for some people in our party,\" Flake told The Associated Press.\nAbout a dozen of the most contested states will help determine which candidate gets the 270 electoral votes to win the presidency. In Arizona, where the Republican nominee has carried the state in 11 of the past 12 presidential elections, Johnson could play the spoiler, potentially putting 11 electoral votes in Clinton's column.\nThe GOP's recent struggle with independent-minded, small-government Libertarians was clear before Trump's speech Wednesday in Phoenix, when he reaffirmed a hard line on immigration. And his stance could alienate the roughly one-quarter of Hispanic voters in the state who usually align with Republicans.\n\"I think that right now we're at a tipping point, where at any moment we are going to begin to see an outpouring of support,\" said Latino GOP strategist Juan Hernandez, who works for Johnson in Arizona.\nSensing an opportunity herself, Clinton began airing television advertisements in the state Friday, and has reserved $500,000 in ad time through mid-September.\nDemocratic strategist Andy Barr said Hispanic turnout was \"the multimillion-dollar question.\" About one-third of the state's population identifies as Latino, but their share of the vote ranges between 12 percent and 16 percent, according to public and private polling.\n\"This closer it gets to 20 percent, the more our chances of winning go up,\" Barr said.\nJohnson will appear on the ballot in every state this fall, while Green Party nominee Jill Stein is on track to make it in at least half. Neither is remotely within reach of carrying a state. Neither seems in a position to tip any state toward Trump.\nBut Johnson could move a close race toward Clinton, in much the same way that Ralph Nader pulled enough votes away from Democrat Al Gore in 2000 to hand Florida to Republican George W. Bush.\nFour years ago, Libertarian candidates in Arizona drew enough votes away from Republicans that Democrats Ann Kirkpatrick and Kyrsten Sinema won election to the U.S. House.\nFlake, who had endeared himself to many Libertarians while serving in the House, won his Senate race that year, too.\n\"It's a really sore spot for the party,\" Arizona Republican Party spokesman Tim Sifert said of those 2012 results. \"You could see people frustrated, throwing away their vote and going with a third-party candidate.\"\nThe views of most Libertarians, focused on personal liberty and small government, overlap more with Republicans than Democrats. Johnson's call for dramatically lower business taxes and regulation to unburden entrepreneurs resonates with Matthew Sherman of Phoenix, who describes himself as more as a conservative than as a Republican.\n\"I'm for whoever has the best plan on startup companies,\" said the 31-year-old who's working on a business networking app. \"So far, that's Gary.\"\nRepublican Dave Richins, a councilman in Mesa City, said Johnson is conservative on spending, but tolerant on social issues, which he calls \"a pragmatic combination.\"\n\"For me, a lifelong Republican, I don't agree with everything Johnson proposes,\" said Richins, a Johnson organizer. \"But I find his pragmatism refreshing. That's how we get things done.\"\nJohnson's hands-off approach to government also includes decriminalizing marijuana, and he could benefit from a November ballot proposal in Arizona on that question.\n\"That's another reason for Libertarians to vote in higher numbers,\" said Barr, who is running the decriminalization campaign. \"We're inclined to believe that could increase Johnson's performance.\"\nAt the beginning of August, Johnson's campaign had $1.2 million after raising $1.6 million in July, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Since Aug. 1, he's raised more than $3 million, according to his campaign. That's a paltry sum compared with Trump and Clinton, whose campaign said it raised a total of $143 million last month.\nJohnson is spending in a few competitive campaign states, including Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin, and less competitive ones such as Oregon, New Mexico and Utah.\nArizona is not on that list, but aides say it likely will be this fall.\n\"As a New Mexican, he's fairly well known in Arizona,\" said Johnson's spokesman, Joe Hunter. \"Arizona makes sense for us.

In retrospect, Sun and her family believe he was being played. \n\u201cThis was a setup that trapped a simple American young man for the benefit of gaining legal status for this woman's entire family, her mother, and her brother,\u201d Sun said. \u201cBy finding a victim like my son, they can stay in this country and immediately enjoy all the social benefits.\u201d Related Image Expand / Contract Both Steinberg and Vaughan warn the US visa system is being exploited by immigrants. \nThe reason for the parting double message seemed to become clear when Sun\u2019s son was arrested and learned his erstwhile paramour had gone to campus police claiming he was stalking her. \nEvery time he texted her, he unknowingly provided digital evidence to prove her claim. That made her and her family members eligible for the only prize they were ever really after, according to Sun and immigration experts: A green card known to bureaucrats and applicants as the \u201cU\u201d visa, which would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and ultimately gain citizenship. \nImmigrants, whether legal or illegal, may apply for the U visa if they are victims of certain crimes, including stalking and domestic violence, and if they help law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution. The U visa, created as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, allows the alleged victims to remain in the U.S. while assisting law enforcement, and they can then become eligible to adjust to lawful permanent resident status. \nAccording to the Department of Homeland Security, the U visa is in place largely to protect women and children who may be victims of crimes such as human trafficking, domestic violence, sexual assault and other abuse, but are afraid to report the crimes due to factors including the language barrier, cultural differences, lack of knowledge of U.S. laws and deportation fears. \nFormer Arapahoe County (Colo.) District Attorney Michael Steinberg, who now specializes in such cases, said, \"anyone who enters the country illegally and can produce a restraining order or affidavit, even with no hard evidence of abuse, is likely to be approved for a work permit and permanent residency.\" \nSteinberg, in a paper posted on his website, notes that accused individuals such as Sun's son are not allowed to offer Customs and Immigration Services evidence, even if it shows the petitioner has engaged in criminal behavior. The U visa provision even brings to a halt deportation proceedings that may have already been under way, Steinberg said. \nA local prosecutor charged Sun\u2019s son with stalking, and while the first trial ended in a hung jury, he was convicted on retrial. \n\u201cIt has been devastating for my son, our family and the people who know about this relationship and care about my son,\u201d Sun said, noting the family is considering an appeal. \nIf it was a con, it was not the first of its kind, say experts. While foreign nationals unquestionably experience domestic violence in America, savvy scammers know that playing the card opens up loopholes to legal residency and even citizenship. \n\u201cEvery week we hear from people who have been taken advantage of by fraudsters,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear these stories of citizens who are duped and not only have their hearts broken, but often their bank account drained and lose their good name to false accusations of abuse, but is a predictable consequence of giving out green cards to anyone who claims to have been the victim of a crime.\u201d \nThe number of people submitting U visa applications to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services claiming to be victims of crime has increased dramatically in recent years, rising to 52,666 last year from 24,768 applicants in 2012. The number is on track to reach nearly 58,000 by year\u2019s end. \n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that there has suddenly been a wave of domestic violence or victimization of immigrants,\u201d Vaughan said. \u201cInstead, the advocates for illegal immigrants have realized that these special green card programs are a way to launder the status of many illegal aliens in the absence of a larger amnesty.\u201d \nJohn Sampson, a retired Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, who now operates CSI Consulting and Investigations, which specializes in helping U.S. citizens victimized by foreign national visa scams, was an expert witness in the Suns\u2019 case. \n\"If he was harassing her, why didn't she block his number, get a new phone, tell his parents about him, or get a restraining order before a year's time? Why subject herself to a year's long harassment that turned into stalking?\" \nSampson said claiming to be a victim of stalking, harassment or domestic violence to obtain a U visa is a common scenario. \u201cUnfortunately, most of the courts and prosecutors are fully unaware of what is going on. They have no idea,\u201d Sampson said. \nThe so-called \u201cdomestic violence\u201d visas are even easier to obtain if the underlying relationship blooms into a marriage, Sampson warned. \nOf the more than 450,000 immigrant visas issued on the basis of a marriage to a U.S. citizen each year, nearly 30 percent are fraudulent, Sampson said, citing US ICE statistics. \n\u201cIt is these one-sided immigration marriage fraud schemes that cause the most damage to unsuspecting U.S. citizens and their families,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cThey are abused emotionally, financially, psychologically and, often times, physically. And no one seems to be interested in stopping this heinous crime.\u201d \nAll the foreign nationals have to do, Sampson said, is allege they are the victim of domestic violence or abuse, even on the same day of marriage, and then they become a permanent resident alien \u201cin an instant.\u201d \nObstacles that normally prevent a foreign national from obtaining a green card \u2013 or being deported \u2013 are waived for those claiming domestic violence because the foreign national is now the victim, said Sampson. \n\u201cIt's the mother of all \u2018Get Out of Jail Free Cards,\u2019\u201d Sampson said. \nIn addition to having their hearts broken, U.S. citizens taken in by the scam can have their lives ruined and even be sent to prison. Some have seen their bank accounts emptied by newly-minted resident aliens, who often go straight onto the government dole, Sampson said. \nNew Jersey resident Elena Maria Lopez claims she was targeted in an immigration marriage fraud scheme, and now runs an advocacy website to educate the public about such scams. \n\u201cThe easiest way to get a quick green card is by claiming domestic violence against your American spouse,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cMaking such unsubstantiated, uninvestigated allegations can help you bypass background checks and is almost a guaranteed green card for foreign nationals that would've been flagged on many other levels.\u201d \nWhile immigrants are often eligible for pro bono legal help, including immigration fraud, no such help is available to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents scammed by immigrants for legal status, Lopez said. \nDani Bennett, spokesman for ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, said the agency places a high priority on investigating identity and benefit fraud. \n\u201cThese types of fraud pose a severe threat to homeland security and public safety because they create a vulnerability that enables criminals and other nefarious actors to gain entry and remain in the United States,\u201d Bennett said. \nIn 2015, Homeland Security Investigations arrested 873 individuals on federal criminal charges related to benefit fraud and another 1,282 individuals on federal document fraud charges, Bennett said. \nThere\u2019s no doubt there are true victims of domestic violence, and the Violence Against Women Act, initially signed into law in 1994, has been key in getting the abused much-needed protection, said Claude Arnold, a retired U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations. \n\u201cThis is a tough situation,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou want to have the law protect domestic violence victims, yet the law also creates another vulnerability in our immigration system that is exploited by fraudsters.\u201d Advertisement", "Makes a lot of sense ?

The refugee crisis is expected to be a central issue in discussions Friday at a meeting in Athens of leaders from Mediterranean countries in the European Union. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)   ATHENS, Greece \u2013   The Greek government is adamantly opposing the revival of a European Union rule that would allow the forcible return to its territory of asylum-seekers who entered the bloc via Greece \u2014 a path followed by more than a million people in the past two years.\nImmigration is high on the agenda of a meeting Friday in Athens of southern European leaders. The group includes Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country, with Greece, is Europe's main immigration gateway.\nAhead of the talks, a government spokesman on immigration said Athens rejects reactivation of the so-called Dublin Regulation, which would allow other EU members to send asylum-seekers back to Greece.\n\"A country such as Greece which receives a large number of refugees from Turkey, and also hosts a large number of refugees \u2014 practically without any outside help \u2014 cannot be asked to receive refugees from other European countries,\" Giorgos Kyritsis told The Associated Press. \"That would be outrageous.\"\nThe Dublin Regulation that governs the Schengen passport-free area stipulates that people wishing to apply for asylum must do so in the first member country they arrive in. In most cases that was Greece, whose eastern islands were overwhelmed last year by migrants packed into smugglers boats from Turkey. But even before last year's migration crisis, many of its EU partners had stopped enforcing the rule because Greece's asylum and migrant reception systems were below standard.\nNow, however, both Germany and the EU executive are pressing for the rule to be restored, with EU officials saying that Greece must meet the Dublin standards by the end of this year.\nBrad Blitz, migration expert and professor of international politics at Middlesex University in Britain, said sending large numbers of asylum-seekers back to Greece would apply an ever greater strain on the country's asylum system and reception capacity.\n\"Unless there is an effective means of redistribution across the EU, a revised Dublin system will force refugees upon receiving states closest to the external border, above all Greece, Italy and to a lesser extent Spain,\" he said.\n\"It will do so by insisting they apply for asylum in Greece, and potentially by returning them from other EU states to Greece. In sum, this will enable returns and discourage EU states from accepting more refugees, including Greece,\" Blitz said.\nKyritsis, the government official, said Greece considers the Dublin rule to be \"practically dead\" because it does not address current migratory pressures and should be drastically overhauled. He added that calls for its reintroduction are to a degree linked with domestic political concerns in Germany, and he argued that EU members are lagging in implementing commitments to take in refugees from Greece \u2014 part of an EU-Turkey deal this year to stem the migratory flow.\nKyritsis said the migrant relocation deal ought to have seen 33,000 people transferred to other EU countries from Greece so far. Instead, only 3,000 have made the journey.\n\"There are 7,000 people ready and waiting to be relocated, so in this field other European countries and the European Union do not appear to ... have done what they ought to have done,\" he said.\nAbout 60,000 refugees and other migrants remain trapped in Greece since a series of Balkan border closures in March, which were closely followed by a March EU-Turkey deal that provides for the return to Turkey of all migrants who get across to Greece.\nHuman rights groups have criticized the agreement, saying it condemns refugees to an uncertain future in Turkey, and implementation has proved problematic as Greek authorities struggle to process asylum bids by people arguing that they shouldn't be sent back.\nThe agreement is also looking increasingly shaky following disagreements over visa-free entry to the EU for Turks and simmering tensions between individual bloc members and Turkey.\nKyritsis, however, said Athens has no indication that the deal will not hold.\n\"There are problems, a negotiation is under way ... we hope for the best,\" he said.\nFriday's talks are in preparation for next week's informal EU summit in Bratislava, although Greek organizers insist it's not an attempt to heighten division between Europe's prosperous north and financially beleaguered south.\nGreece's left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, together with Italy's Renzi, French President Francois Hollande and the leaders of Portugal, Cyprus and Malta, will also be discussing investment and job creation, as well as security.

I don\u2019t sit, but for years now I don\u2019t sing and I don\u2019t place my hand over my heart during the Pledge of Allegiance. I\u2019m an American, born to undocumented parents in a country that doesn\u2019t want them. All my life, I have existed with the duality of growing up here, even as this country treats my family, and me by extension, like second-class citizens.\nLike Kaepernick, I won\u2019t be proud of this country until this country treats all of our communities - African Americans, immigrants and people of color- the same as the white majority. Until that day comes to pass, I will sit. - Elice Rojas-Cruz\nThe reaction to Kaepernick\u2019s silent protest has been fierce and divisive. The San Francisco 49er\u2019s player said he wouldn\u2019t show pride in a flag that oppresses black and brown people. Soccer player Megan Rapinoe took a knee in support of Kaepernick, who she said has been maligned by a news media unwilling \u2013 or unable \u2013 to cover the issue fairly. As a lesbian woman, she said that she knows what it\u2019s like to feel discriminated against in this country. Their actions created an uproar, even though for some time now celebrities and sports figures have been more vocal about their political and social concerns.\nUnlike most of us, Kaepernick has a national platform on which he can display his beliefs. His actions struck a chord. I identify with Kaepernick\u2019s actions and have the same concerns. I, too, will sit with him.\nFrom a young age, I had trouble showing pride in my country. Born and raised in New York, I grew up with undocumented parents. I kept my family secret for nearly 10 years. During that time, federal immigration officials threatened to deport them. I questioned why we lived in the United States when it was clear the country didn\u2019t want us here. I didn\u2019t understand why my family was considered a threat to the only place I\u2019ve ever known. Immigration came at us hard.\nEvery time we passed a police officer or had an encounter with a government or school official, we faced the threat that my family would be torn apart. Even as a young child, I spent my life with a heightened sense of awareness.\nWhen I was 12, my parents decided to make things right. They applied for residency, but were denied and instead received their first deportation orders. Which meant that as my friends were worrying about the latest clothes or being cool, I was questioning my identity as an American.\nWhere did we \u2013 I \u2013 belong if not here. In the end, my parents decided to risk staying and lived quietly hidden in suburbia for many years after that. My parents believed in my future so strongly that they refused to leave. I was a bright student and held the potential to be the first  in my family to graduate from college. My parents thought the risk was worth it if it meant I would have opportunities to thrive in the United States.\nMy early questioning turned into anger and frustration. I would stand during the Pledge of Allegiance in school, but I refused to place my hand over my heart. I was born here, but I didn\u2019t feel protected by the same rights as my white classmates under that red, white and blue flag. My peers and teachers gave me side-eye glances, but no one made a big deal because I was still standing for the flag. In post-9/11 New York, a few students chose to sit during the pledge. I watched those students get pulled into the principal\u2019s office and questioned extensively. I couldn\u2019t risk revealing my family\u2019s identity. So I stood, but protested in my own quiet way. I didn\u2019t recite, I didn\u2019t sing, and I would not place my hand over my heart.\nIt wasn\u2019t until college that I publically owned up to my parents\u2019 status. I met the most nationalistic, U-S-A-chanting people I had ever met in my life. I told a few friends that I didn\u2019t buy into such patriotism. That I actually didn\u2019t love America all that much. I was met with stunned faces, quickly followed by a screaming argument. \u201cHow could you not love America? U.S.A. IS NUMBER ONE!\u201d they argued. I felt attacked and scared. But it emboldened me enough to say for the first time out loud, \u201cMy parents are undocumented. This country does not want us here. How could I love a country that wants nothing to do with us?\u201d Silence. The conversation never came up again and I was never questioned furhter. I was terrified revealing my family\u2019s identity, but I also felt free to live my truth. Throughout the ensuing years, I told confidants about my family and what it was like growing up afraid in the country of your birth. When my parents finally became residents, I spoke about it publicly, on the internet, no less.\nIt\u2019s been years since those experiences, but the same fear, frustration and sadness with a country that can\u2019t embrace all of us, flooded back to me when I read about Kaepernick and why he was sitting for what he believes in. It takes a lot of courage and strength to act, and the attacks by the media and threats by police unions are unfair and unwarranted. His right to say what he believes does not mean that he\u2019s a threat to this country, let alone his football team and fans. He is living his truth.\nMy views have changed a bit now that my parents have their papers. I\u2019m proud that they are residents of the United States. Hopefully one day they will become citizens and I can watch them exercise their rights fully under that red, white and blue flag. But for now, I still can't place my hand on my heart because I know there are still immigrant children, families, and individuals that deserve comprehensive immigration reform and equal protection under the law. Like Kaepernick, I won\u2019t be proud of this country until this country treats all of our communities - African Americans, immigrants and people of color- the same as the white majority.

Doug Ducey, said Tuesday that state lawyers were reviewing the lawsuit and that he could not immediately answer specific questions about the policy.\nThe suit comes less than two years after a federal judge forced the state to grant driver's licenses to recipients of the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA \u2014 a program for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children that protects them from deportation and allows them to work.\nIt followed a long legal battle that began when then-Gov. Jan Brewer issued a directive banning them from getting licenses. She said the decision grew out of liability concerns and the desire to reduce the risk of the licenses being used to improperly access public benefits.\nImmigrants protected from deportation for reasons other than being childhood arrivals were then banned from getting licenses after a federal court ruled that the state's policy on DACA recipients was unconstitutional in part because it excluded one group of immigrants while including another.\nFive Arizona immigrants who have deferred action because they are victims of domestic abuse or are children of victims say the state must give them licenses because they have authorization to be in the country.\nThe lawsuit names one woman who has cancer and cannot always get to her treatment appointments because she does not have a license, but lawyers say thousands of immigrants are affected by the revised policy.\nAnother woman is awaiting approval of a special visa for victims of domestic violence and has received deferred action in the meantime. She says she can't get a better job because she can't get a license.\nViramontes said the state should have started allowing all deferred action recipients to get licenses following the federal court ruling instead of letting some get them but denying them to others.\n\"They should have stopped discriminating the minute this policy was declared unconstitutional, but they keep doing it,\" Viramontes said.\nBased on reporting by the Associated Press. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "By Chris Stirewalt \n  Email Print **Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

As he hits the campaign trail for her today in Pennsylvania, that question hangs heavy in the air like aroma of a cheesesteak from John\u2019s Roast Pork.\n\nTo understand the heritability of Obama\u2019s current popularity we must first consider its origins.\n\nThings are getting better in a number of ways. As the Census Bureau reported today, 2015 saw the first increase in median wages since 2007. It\u2019s been a long time coming, but a gain of more than 5 percent is the kind of boost that gets voters feeling better about the shape of things. Gas prices remain low. Stock prices remain high. The job market remains steady.\n\nNor has there been a successful domestic terror attack since the Orlando massacre in June. While there are many, and maybe multiplying, threats around the globe, Obama has mostly weathered the criticisms surrounding his policies for ISIS and Russian aggression. Obama took heat for go-slow strategies, but seems to have muddled through so far.\n\nBut Halftime Report would hold that this is more about what Vice President Joe Biden likes to say: \u201cDon\u2019t compare us to the Almighty, compare us to the alternative.\u201d Given the historically high levels of dissatisfaction with the major party nominee\u2019s this cycle and a campaign season that feels like a cross between an episode of \u201cVeep\u201d and \u201cTales from the Crypt.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s low-key leadership may be looking better to Americans who previously imagined a much different menu of options in 2016. Because in truth, there is plenty for Americans to be displeased about with Obama. Obamacare is falling apart like knock-off Rolex. Racial tensions are at a generational high. Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran looks like an increasingly bad bargain.\n\nAnd, most of all, the sense of decline that wreathes so many American communities \u2013 manifested in drug addiction, abandonment of work, parental obligations neglected and rootlessness -- seems to be getting worse and not better.\n\nOne of the other reasons Obama may be more popular is that he has been in short supply, for a change. Until Trump, no public figure had dominated the national discussion the way Obama did from 2007 to 2014. His health plan, his shirtless beach pics, his dog, his cigarettes, his birth certificate, his fiscal cliff, his wife\u2019s shoulders, his golf outings, his push for gun control, and on, and on, and on\u2026\n\nTrump having replaced Obama as the media obsession has allowed Obama to rebuild some of the esteem he lost during seven years of overexposure. Now he wants to cash in his restored political capital to help elect a Democratic successor to keep his legacy intact.\n\nAnd lord, does she need him.\n\nWe once thought that Bill Clinton would be his wife\u2019s surrogate-in-chief. But as the prospective First Gentleman has shown, he is hardly in possession of his once-prodigious gifts.\n\nBubba is fine to pinch hit for his stricken spouse with donors, in interviews and even at a rally this week in Las Vegas. But she needs more than he can deliver, especially with increasingly loud voices discussing the possibility of her having to drop out of the race.\n\nRather than the march to a landslide victory that some Clintonistas were contemplating just a few weeks ago, her grasp of even the nomination she won three months ago looks a little tenuous. She needs backup and more than her able, amiable running mate, Tim Kaine , can provide.\n\nTeam Clinton has a plan to show that she is up to the challenge of running for and serving as president, trying the novel approach of transparency with the release of medical records on Thursday and presumably her engaging in various feats of strength on the campaign by week\u2019s end. Last time, they had her open a pickle jar, maybe now she\u2019ll box a kangaroo or split a fence post with an ax.\n\nThough Obama can deliver major benefits to Clinton, particularly in her bid to mobilize black, Hispanic, young and upscale suburban voters his help is not an unalloyed benefit. Not only does he further affix his stamp on Clinton, robbing her of the chance to run as a candidate of change, he also may see his own popularity diminish.\n\nIf Americans are liking Obama better these days because he\u2019s off the front page and above the political fray, he may remind them what they didn\u2019t like about him at the end of last year when his approval ratings were stuck in the low 40s.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: KINGLY POWERS, BUT NOT A ROYAL LINE\n\u201c[The president] is to be elected for  four  years; and is to be re-eligible as often as the people of the United States shall think him worthy of their confidence.

New Jersey law enforcement would not say if a pipe bomb that exploded at a seaside community was terror-related. Officials said an attack at a Minnesota mall in which a man stabbed nine people was being investigated as a possible act of terrorism; an Islamic State-run news agency called the attacker a \"soldier of the Islamic State.\" \nIn a statement Sunday, the Democratic presidential candidate said law enforcement officials in New York and New Jersey need support as they investigate. \nClinton said of the Minnesota attack, \"this should steel our resolve to protect our country and defeat ISIS.\" \n___ \n11:15 a.m. \nRepublican running mate Mike Pence says \"we're all troubled in our hearts\" about explosions Saturday in New Jersey and New York and a knife attack in Minnesota. \nPence spoke Sunday during a service at the 7,700-seat First Baptist Church of Jacksonville. Pence did not say if he has been briefed on the two explosions or the mall stabbing where eight people were injured before the attacker was shot and killed by police. No one was killed in either of the explosions Saturday. \nPence is giving thanks that no one else died \"as a result of these horrific attacks.\" Pence says he is praying for those who are recovering from their injuries as well as the first responders and those investigating the incidents. Pence says that whether the incidents were acts of terrorism or inspired by terrorists, \"prayer and vigilance is the order of the day.\" \n___ \n11:00 a.m. \nHillary Clinton's vice presidential running mate has split with her over Clinton's description of some Donald Trump supporters as \"irredeemable.\" \nTim Kaine said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that irredeemable \"is not a word I would use.\" But he suggested that it's not likely the Democrats would be able to change the minds of hardcore Trump supporters on such issues as where President Barack Obama was born. \nKaine says Clinton was right to call out \"dark emotions.\" \nClinton earlier this month said she considers \"half\" of Trump's supporters to be \"deplorables\" who are \"irredeemable.\" She later apologized for saying \"half\" and acknowledged that many of his supporters are hardworking, but disillusioned. \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nRepublican vice presidential running mate Mike Pence is dismissing as \"absolute nonsense\" any suggestion that Donald Trump is suggesting violence against Hillary Clinton. \nTrump on Friday told a crowd in Miami that since Clinton is for gun control, her Secret Service detail should disarm and, \"let's see what happens to her.\" \nPence said on ABC's \"This Week\" that Trump was suggesting Clinton has been protected by gun-toting security guards for decades. Pence said Trump's point was that \"she'd change her attitude about the right to keep and bear arms \" if she didn't have a security detail. \nPence said he'd \"bet that's probably true.\" \n___ \n9:35 a.m. \nDonald Trump's most visible supporters are insisting that \"birtherism\" is no longer an issue for the Republican presidential nominee. \nThat's what vice presidential running mate Mike Pence, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and others are saying on Sunday news shows. They said Trump's comments Friday acknowledging that President Barack Obama was born in the United States cancels out Trump's five years of suggesting otherwise. The surrogates also insisted that a confidant of Hillary Clinton's started peddling the theory that Obama was born in Kenya, that Trump has been a victim of unfair media coverage over the issue and that Americans don't care about the issue, anyway. \nTrump on Friday falsely claimed that Clinton had started the birther discussion. \nPence declared on ABC's \"This Week\" that \"it's over.\" Host Martha Raddatz replied: \"It's not over.\" \n___ \n9:20 a.m. \nDemocrat Tim Kaine is offering five \"litmus test\" issues that show millennials are more closely aligned with Hillary Clinton, even if they don't like or trust her. \nClinton's running mate appeared on all four Sunday shows in pursuit of young voters who polls show have cooled on Clinton in recent weeks. \nHis main argument is that she stands with young voters on issues they care about, including climate science, women's health, LGBT equality, immigration reform and making college more affordable. \nKaine said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"it's on our shoulders\" to make the case to millennials that Clinton stands with them on those issues. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nDonald Trump's running mate says if elected he would model his vice presidency after Dick Cheney. \nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence told ABC's \"This Week\" in an interview that aired Sunday that he holds Cheney \"in really high regard.\" Cheney served two terms as Vice President under George W. Bush and was known for playing an active role in the Bush White House. \nPence is a former 12-year congressman and says he envisions emulating Cheney in working closely with the House and Senate to implement Trump's agenda. \nPence says he has talked with Trump about what his role would be, but declined to talk more about \"our private conversations.\" \nPence is campaigning in Florida this weekend and was scheduled to be interviewed about his faith by a minister in Jacksonville at a church service Sunday. \n___ \n2:57 a.m. \nPresident Barack Obama is making it clear that he'll take it personally if the African-American community fails to turn out for the presidential election and support Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. \nObama delivered his final keynote address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Saturday night and said his name may not be on the ballot, but issues of importance to the black community are. \nAnd he realizes that a victory for Republican Donald Trump could undo much of what he has done. Clinton also made a pitch at the same dinner for African-Americans' support. \nThe Republican nominee campaigned in Houston, where he talked to a gathering of the Remembrance Project, a group founded to remember those killed by people living illegally in the U.S. and to press for tougher laws. Advertisement", "Obama, in final UN speech, urges more help for refugees Published September 20, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nPresident Obama, in his final address as president before the U.N. General Assembly, called Tuesday for more global cooperation especially in helping refugees from war-torn countries \u2013 while making only passing reference to the Islamic State and the ever-expanding scourge of like-minded terror groups. \nThe president called for a \u201ccourse correction\u201d for globalization to ensure nations don't retreat into a more sharply divided world, while pushing back against an isolationist approach gaining popularity in many countries. He advocated for open democracies and open economies, while railing against the example set by Russia and calling for more tolerance in all nations. \nHe also took what appeared to be a jab at Donald Trump, saying: \u201cThe world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall\u201d and prevent extremism from affecting societies. \nWith that message in hand, Obama urged nations to \u201cfollow through even when the politics are hard,\u201d in helping refugees fleeing conflict. \n\u201cWe have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have the empathy to see ourselves.\u201d \nThe appeal comes ahead of a refugee summit Obama was hosting Tuesday afternoon with the leaders of Jordan, Mexico, Sweden, Germany, Canada and Ethiopia, along with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. \nYet despite Obama\u2019s focus toward the end of his speech on the refugee crisis, he made little mention of terrorism, aside from describing how persecution and intolerance in the Middle East contributed to the Syrian civil war and the \u201cmindless medieval menace\u201d of ISIS \u2013 and saying this violence \"will not be quickly reversed.\" \nThe president, though, was unabashed in his critique of Russia as he laid out his diagnosis of the world's ills. Obama's longstanding differences with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his actions in Ukraine have accompanied intense disagreement over Syria's future and a series of failed attempts by Russia and the U.S. to resolve the civil war there together. \n\"In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,\" Obama said. \nThe president's focus on refugees comes after Obama was criticized by other nations for not doing enoughto help those fleeing their countries because of war or for other reasons. \nCountries participating in the summit Tuesday are expected to announce individual pledges that are in line with a U.S. goal of increasing humanitarian aid by $3 billion, doubling resettlement and providing access to jobs and education, said Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. \nLast week, the White House announced that the U.S. would resettle 110,000 refugees in the coming year, a 30 percent increase over the 85,000 allowed in this year. \nObama also faces security concerns at home, though, over the prospect of admitting more refugees. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has made warnings about such refugees a centerpiece of his campaign -- the candidate renewed those warnings in the wake of weekend terror attacks in Minnesota, New York and New Jersey involving foreign-born suspects. He and other Republicans also seized on a new watchdog report finding more than 800 immigrants from countries of concern who were set for deportation were mistakenly granted U.S. citizenship because the Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t have their fingerprints on file. \nWorld leaders, though, are grappling with the largest crisis of displaced persons since World War II -- more than 65 million people who have fled their homes because of armed conflict or persecution, or because they are seeking asylum or a better way of life. \nPower said the U.N. summit wouldn't be a \"panacea\" for the crisis, but would show what the U.S. can achieve when it leads on an issue of global concern. \nThe administration\u2019s 85,000 figure included 10,000 Syrian refugees, a figure advocacy groups had criticized as inadequate given the wealth of the U.S. and the fact that other countries, such as Canada and Germany, were welcoming far greater numbers of Syrians fleeing the civil war there. \nMore than four dozen U.S. businesses also pledged $650 million in support to help refugees, the White House announced Tuesday. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Related Image Expand / Contract Nisa Mickens, (l.), and Kayla Cuevas, (r.) \nSuffolk County police said on Friday that the department was launching an \"all-out assault\" on gangs in the 11-square-mile town as well as in Central Islip and Wyandanch. \nArea residents are worried and frightened given the notorious El Salvadorean gang's growth in the area, which they say has coincided with an influx of illegal immigrants. \n\u201cWithout a doubt the community is scared, but I know of instances where residents have heard things and have called police,\u201d says Ray Mayo, executive director, Brentwood Association for Concerned Citizens. \nMayo said that while he has seen a direct correlation between the infusion of Central American teens in the community and the increase in gang activity, the community is not putting up with it. \n\u201cWe have been in regular talks with the police to come up with some strategies,\u201d says Mayo. \nHe said residents are supportive of immigrants, even undocumented, who have come to Brentwood to better their lives and who are law abiding, paying their taxes, and striving towards citizenship. It is the other, growing and nefarious immigrant element that concerns Mayo. \nLaw enforcement officials say MS-13 is the largest gang on Long Island with Suffolk County \u201ccliques\u201d concentrated in the villages of Brentwood, Huntington, Copiague, Farmingdale, and Islip. \nSuffolk County Legislator for Brentwood, Monica Martinez, a former teacher and school district administrator, says she has seen a transformation in recent years of this predominantly African-American and Hispanic working class community 47 miles east of New York City. \n\u201cWe have seen an influx of them to the district, one in which no child was denied access to an education,\u201d Martinez says. \u201cThere is no indication that the current incidents have been a result of the influx of unaccompanied children.\u201d \nMartinez said these types of incidents have occurred in waves. \n\u201cWe had a surge in 2012-2013 and unfortunately we are seeing it again,\u201d she says. \u201cActually after researching a bit myself the sharpest increase in violent crime was in 2010,\u201d \nBetween October 2013 and July 2016 nearly 3,500 unaccompanied children from Central America were placed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Suffolk County, one of the highest placement areas in the country. The overwhelming majority are law-abiding and welcome, say residents. But some come with gang experience and others are ripe for recruitment, according to law enforcement sources. \nEven before 2013, Brentwood was a hotbed for gang violence with skirmishes between MS-13, the Latin Kings and Bloods. Eventually, the Salvadoran gang claimed a violent stranglehold on the community. \nSome of the more heinous acts of violence Brentwood experienced began in 2008, when members of MS-13 were involved in a non-fatal shooting incident in a Brentwood park. In 2009, several MS-13 gang members attacked suspected rival gang members at a house party killing one. This was followed in 2010 when the violence spun out of control. \nMS-13 gang members, committed two murders and one attempted murder in February and March 2010. One member was convicted in connection with the murder of 21-year-old David Sandler and the attempted murder of 20-year-old Aaron Galan in Brentwood. \nOne of the prime suspects convicted in many of these violent crimes was already an MS-13 member in El Salvador when he entered the U.S. illegally. \nAlso in 2010, the Sailors clique of the MS-13 suspected that fellow member Rigoberto Gomez was cooperating with local law enforcement. As a result, the Sailors put a \u201cgreen light\u201d on Gomez, authorizing other MS-13 members to kill Gomez on sight. \nIn the early morning hours of Aug. 31, 2010, Hector Torres, then second in command of the BLS clique, together with a Sailors clique member, who has also been charged federally, spotted Gomez as they drove through Brentwood. They lured Gomez into the car, inviting him to smoke marijuana with them at a nearby park. Gomez was shot three times in the head and killed. \nMost recently, before the Mickens and Cuevas killings, three teen age gang members were charged with the brutal gang rape of a 16-year-old girl by the Brentwood Country Club in 2015. \nThe discovery of four dead teenagers in one week, possibly at the hands of MS-13, has sparked outrage. \nLenny Tucker, president, Brentwood Association for Concerned Citizens, said the community was taken by surprise with the influx of Central American teens and is outraged at the impact the violence the gang has had on their community as well as the lack of attention paid by the federal government. \n\u201cAfter all of the community\u2019s hard work to keep our children safe, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the federal government has done its due diligence or us any justice.\u201d \nTucker says the children coming into Brentwood have been exposed to violence in their countries and have a mindset of lack of control to violent behavior. \nMickens was buried Wednesday and Cuevas on Friday.

Current and former State Department officials say that an attempt in late 2014 to have a legal finding of genocide was blocked by the Defense Department, setting back efforts to prosecute IS members suspected of committing war crimes. \n\"The West looks to the United States for leadership in the Middle East, and the focus of this administration has been elsewhere \u2014 in every respect,\" Bill Wiley, the head of the independent investigative group, the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, told The Associated Press. \nOfficials in Washington say that the Defense Department and ultimately the administration were concerned that court trials would distract from the military campaign. But the diplomats say that justice is essential in a region whose religious minorities have been terrorized. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. \nThe U.S. has no legal obligation to take on the genocide of the Yazidis, but President Barack Obama has said that \"preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America.\" \nStephen Rapp, who stepped down as the administration's ambassador at large for war crimes last year, says the administration should have moved early to help secure evidence of IS atrocities and push for the creation of special Iraqi courts to try war crimes. \n\"The priority for the U.S. government is to win the war against the Islamic State and destroy them,\" Rapp said. \"It's been profoundly disappointing, because the idea of accountability has been such a low priority.\" \nRapp is now the chairman of the advisory board of the commission, whose investigators in Iraq work with the Kurdish regional government to formally document the IS crimes, including those against the Yazidi minority group. They have built a case implicating the entire IS command structure in a plot to kidnap Yazidi women and girls and establish a sex slave market. \nThe plan was executed by an organized bureaucracy, from the temporary sorting facilities \u2014 including a prison, schools and a curtained ballroom where the Yazidis were divided by age and willingness to convert to Islam \u2014 to the waiting buses that would haul them by the dozens across the border to Raqqa. The Islamic State group's Shariah courts soon stepped in, to settle contract disputes and ensure that its finance hierarchy got its cut of the sex-slave proceeds. \n\"You have members of IS who were engaged in ensuring that this system continued and that it functioned well,\" said Chris Engels, the American lawyer who is leading the commission's legal investigation. Without a legal documentation of their identities from the top down, many could \"slide into refugee streams\" and disappear, he said. \nThough there are at least dozens of Islamic State extremists in custody in Iraq, there have been no prosecutions for the crimes against humanity that the U.S. \u2014 among many others \u2014 insist have taken place. On Tuesday, the Obama administration's envoy for the coalition to counter Islamic State militants, Brett McGurk, tweeted that he \"pledged full accountability\" for Islamic State crimes against the Yazidis, whom IS considers infidels because of their religion. \nIn 2012, Obama announced what he called a comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to war crimes with the establishment of an atrocities prevention board. \nBut in a recent investigation, the AP found that even in territories liberated from IS militants by Kurdish forces, dozens of mass graves have been left unsecured. \n\"It's a tragedy that we are not getting in there and securing these sites where we can and doing things like collecting DNA evidence,\" said Rapp. \nA measure by the House that calls on the U.S. to fund precisely the kind of court envisioned by the investigators is unlikely to advance anytime soon in an election year. The war crimes commission says it would need about $6.6 million and about six months to get the trials going. \n\"If the administration was committed to criminal investigations of perpetrators, then it would be robustly funding criminal investigations of perpetrators,\" said Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who sponsored the bill. \nThe State Department said the U.S. was promoting accountability, and spokesman Mark Toner said the administration is \"supporting ongoing efforts to collect, document, preserve, and analyze evidence of atrocities for transitional justice processes.\" He provided no specifics. \n___ \nHinnant reported from Paris.

It is the first time the group has endorsed a candidate for president.\n\u201cThe men and women of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are the last line of defense for American communities. Our 5,000 officers, underfunded and undermanned, are responsible for enforcing immigration laws in a nation of 320 million people,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Chris Crane, said in a statement posted on Trump\u2019s campaign website . \u201cOur officers come into daily contact with many of the most dangerous people in the world \u2013 cartel members, gang members, weapons traffickers, murder suspects, drug dealers, suspects of violent assault \u2013 yet ICE Officers are unable to arrest or are forced to release many of the most dangerous back into U.S. communities due to unscrupulous political agendas and corrupt leaders.\u201d\nIn the statement, Crane slammed the executive orders by President Barack Obama that are supported by Clinton that he said, \u201chave forced our officers to violate their oaths to uphold the law and placed every person living in America at risk \u2013 including increased risk of terrorism.\u201d\n\u201cOur officers are prevented from enforcing the most basic immigration laws, including laws against illegal work, illegal entry, illegal overstay and also the public charge law,\u201d he continued.\nCrane outlined in the statement that the endorsement for Trump was conducted by a vote of the union\u2019s membership and that the former Secretary of State received only 5 percent of the vote.\nImmigration has been a hot-button issue throughout the presidential race, with Trump laying out a hardline position that includes proposing to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and looks to crack down on the flow of undocumented immigrants entering the country.\nAccording to Reuters , a CNN/ORC poll released on Sept. 7 said 49 percent of registered voters said they trusted Clinton to handle immigration, a slight advantage over Trump, who had 47 percent.\nUnlike Trump, Clinton has never reached out to the union to speak to them ahead of creating her immigration agenda, said Crane, who added that her plan would result \u201cin the daily loss of life and victimization of many, to include not only American citizens but also those attempting to immigrate to our country.\u201d\n\u201cAmerica has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America\u2019s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal.\u201d\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "By FOX 5 \nPublished September 30, 2016 Fox News Latino \nGWINNETT COUNTY, Georgia \u2013   You may be surprised to learn that Donald Trump has Hispanic supporters, given his stance on immigration and a comment the Republican Presidential nominee made at the beginning of his campaign about some Mexicans crossing the border being criminals.\nBut members of the Georgia Hispanics for Trump Coalition said they believe Trump has their back.\n\u201cThis country the way its running ... it\u2019s a mess, and I rather have Trump to run it like a business,\u201d said Hispanic Trump supporter, Wilfredo Grajales.\nThe Hispanic voters laid out the reasons why they are supporting Trump during a news conference Thursday evening at the Gwinnett County GOP headquarters.\n\u201cThis is more than just immigration,\u201d said Loganville vice mayor and chair of the Georgia Hispanics for Trump Coalition, Rey Martinez. \u201cThis is social values, this is school choice, this is security for families, this is jobs, this is money in your pocket \u2013 we have to talk about the other issues.\u201d\nMartinez said he wants a president who will do whatever it takes to keep the United States safe, including build a wall, even if it is at the expense of people chasing the American dream.\n\u201cI am in support of doing anything to keep illegal drugs away,\u201d said Martinez. \u201cTo keep gang members away, this is something that has been talked about for many years.

But not many.\n\nThe latest Fox News poll tells the tale. Asked to name the most important issue facing the country, 30 percent of respondents said the economy and 18 percent said terrorism. After that, it falls off dramatically. Just 4 percent named immigration, the same as the number who picked global warming.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that immigration doesn\u2019t matter to a heckuva lot more than 4 percent of the electorate. And it\u2019s also not to say that voters who care about the economy or national security or education don\u2019t also place a great deal of significance on the issue of immigration. Immigration policy seeps into almost everything else.\n\nFor big chunks of voters in both parties, it\u2019s a driving issue. Donald Trump \u2019s primary success with the hardest of hardline stances on the subject is evidence enough of that.\n\nBut those voters are presumably spoken for by now. If immigration is your number one issue, you\u2019re probably not an undecided voter at this point.\n\nSo why is Trump still talking about it loudly and at great length?\n\nIt can\u2019t be that he and his campaign think that hardline immigration voters are up for grabs. The poll makes clear that Trump has little to lose and much to gain from \u201csoftening\u201d on the issue, especially on the issue of deportations. The poll found that 68 percent of white males without college degrees favored a pathway to legal status for illegal immigrants. That\u2019s Trump\u2019s base, and those fellows don\u2019t seem to mind much.\n\nAnd just 15 percent of Republicans said they would be less likely to back Trump if he softened his stance with a similar number of independents saying the same.\n\nTrump seemed to be trying to oblige over the past two weeks as he has undertaken a \u201csoftening,\u201d and did eventually get there. Trump now stands in favor of the traditional \u201cenforcement first\u201d Republican policy of dealing with the border and internal controls before rounding up otherwise law-abiding illegals. But not only did Trump do it in such a way that you had to listen very closely to hear, it took him a long time to do it.\n\nTrump\u2019s problem on immigration isn\u2019t so much what he\u2019s saying but how much he is saying it.\n\nRather than holding rallies with Sen. Jeff Sessions and Joe Arpaio and debating who will pay for the generally unpopular proposal to build a wall at the Mexican border, Trump ought to be figuring out how to win with the suburban voters who are so far spurning his candidacy.\n\nTrump scores even with Hillary Clinton on handling of the economy and only a few points behind on terrorism. He needs to shift the election to these issues instead of endlessly reassuring his base on immigration.\n\nImmigration won Trump his party\u2019s nomination, but it won\u2019t do the same for him in the general.\n\nTIME OUT: SOMETHING ABOUT SATURDAY\nDid you feel it?

But there is so much that is truly wonderful in it at every level.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you know the joys of rooting for one of the truly great programs , there is no place so far out in the country or so close to the center of the biggest city that there isn\u2019t a team to call your own. Whether you went there or not, college football team loyalties are among the very strongest regional and cultural identifiers we have in an increasingly rootless culture.\n\nPerhaps best of all is the music. While the pros are all booty-quaking bass lines and face-melting guitar riffs, college ball is all about the marching band. The feeling of being of a stadium of 70,000 people gone silent as the band takes the field is as pure a pleasure as there is.\n\nFrom the first marching band halftime show in 1907 \u2013 the University of Illinois Marching Illini at the school\u2019s opening game against the University of Chicago \u2013 right up until this Saturday\u2019s kickoff games, those bands and those fans have been part of something that is perhaps as perfectly American as anything in the world.\n\nHave a great day and, of course, let\u2019s go Mountaineers!\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at  HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM  with your tips, comments or questions\n\nSCOREBOARD\nAverage of national head-to-head presidential polls: Clinton vs. Trump : Clinton  +6.2\nAverage of national four-way presidential polls: Clinton vs. Trump vs. Johnson vs. Stein : Clinton +4.6\nGeneric congressional vote :   Democrats +4.2\n\nFBI RELEASES HILLARY EMAIL PROBE NOTES\nWSJ : \u201cOn Friday afternoon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation released a summary of its investigation into allegations that classified information was improperly stored or transmitted on a personal e-mail server Hillary Clinton used during her tenure as secretary of state.

Other than new details, what did he say that he hadn\u2019t said before in broad strokes, even more harshly?\u201d \u2013 Kathy McKenzie , Long Beach, CA\n\n[ Ed. note: Thanks for the question, Ms. McKenzie. I gather you mean members of Trump\u2019s Hispanic outreach team who either departed or expressed concerns following his Wednesday speech in Arizona. One supposes that they had been told to expect something different than what Trump delivered. Trump\u2019s shift on mass-deportations was real, but it was done in such a way that you had to listen closely to hear it. Trump met with Latino leaders last week and reportedly made assurances about the shift in policy and tone. Perhaps he decided to make only a partial pivot. Whatever the case, the political lesson is the same: Be careful about making promises. ]\n\n\u201cChris, my dream right after Trump is sworn in he turns to the microphone and says ( like Marlon Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT) \u2018let\u2019s get to work\u2019 walks directly to the oval office and starts to reverse BO\u2019s executive orders.  No balls, fancy dinners & dances,etc.   The elite of BOTH parties will then understand there is a new sheriff ( of the people) in town \u201d \u2013 Bill McIver , Brooksville, FL.\n\n[ Ed. note: Well, a word of caution about that scene, Mr. Iver. While presidents need to be careful about seeming too interested in pomp and puffery, it\u2019s also important to celebrate. The presidency is a long slog and results are hard to come by. After an hour signing orders vacating executive orders, what would Trump do then? The inaugural festivities help presidents thank their supporters and send a message to other Americans about what kind of administration theirs will be. Jimmy Carter famously carried his own bags and turned down the thermostats in order to show thrift and solidarity with struggling Americans. When the Reagans arrived, the first family brought Hollywood glamour with them to the White House and most certainly the 1981 inaugural. While the press scolded the Reagans, voters didn\u2019t seem to mind. ]\n\n\u201cChris, please clarify. If candidate A and B are reported to be tied at 45 to 45 with a margin of error of 3 points, is it possible that say candidate A actually has a 6 point lead 48 to 42 for example?  Likewise, if it is reported that candidate B is leading candidate A 47 to 44 with 2 point margin of error, could candidate B actually be losing 46 to 45? I am sure a random (fav) network wouldn\u2019t think manipulating poll results although cherry picking which polls to use seems to be a common practice. Say it isn\u2019t so Joe. \u2013 Jim Feakes , Colorado Springs, Colo.\n\n[ Ed. note: Great question, Mr. Freakes. When you think of a poll result and margins of error, picture a toy bow and arrow that shoots suction cups. The shaft of the arrow is the result, but the margin of error is full footprint of the cup. Where would you say the arrow landed? Where the shaft is pointing. The number pollsters give is the most likely result, but the margin of error reflects the fact that polls are imperfect. To use your example, if two candidates were tied at 45 percent in a poll with a margin of error of 3 percent, the range for each candidate would be from 43.5 percent to 46.5 percent \u2013 exactly the same for both of them. The listed result is the center of the range of 3 points, not the start of a three-point range in either direction.

", "  Fox News Latino On the heels of Donald Trump\u2019s controversial immigration speech, in which he vowed to aggressively pursue and deport people who are here illegally, the Hillary Clinton campaign released new ads depicting the GOP nominee as detrimental to Latinos.\nThe ads, which feature Carlos Gutierrez, who was commerce secretary in the administration of George W. Bush, present Trump as someone who would, as president, make life worse for Latinos and immigrants.\nBoth ads are in Spanish. The one featuring Gutierrez is airing in Florida, the second one is airing in Florida and Nevada, two battleground states with a large Hispanic population.\nIn one ad, titled \u201cPais Primero\u201d (Country First), Gutierrez says he has been a lifelong Republican, but that he cannot bring himself to support his party\u2019s nominee. He says: \u201cVote for Trump? I can\u2019t. It\u2019s dangerous, and we can\u2019t go back. Hillary Clinton has the experience, and I trust her\u2026I\u2019ve been a Republican all my life, but first I am an American.\u201d\n\nGutierrez, who was born in Cuba, is one of a few former Bush administration officials who have refused to endorse Trump and have pledged their support to Clinton.\nIn the other ad, named \u201cVerdadera Fuerza,\u201d or Real Strength, a narrator says: \"Because he yells and insults, Donald Trump thinks he's got strength.\u201d\nOne scene shows Trump saying \u201cThey\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists,\u201d about people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nThe ad then describes Clinton\u2019s efforts to improve healthcare, programs for children and describes her as exhibiting real strength.\nIt urges people to register to vote.\nClinton holds a wide lead among Hispanic voters over Trump \u2013 but some are concerned the gap isn\u2019t wide enough.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "  Fox News Latino U.S. Rep. Joe Heck on November 6, 2012 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Getty \nA Democratic super-PAC is set to launch a new Spanish-language ad in Nevada aimed at comparing Republican Rep. Joe Heck to his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Donald Trump.\nThe Senate Majority PAC ad, which will run in Nevada\u2019s two most populous cities of Las Vegas and Reno, draws parallels between Trump and Heck and harangues the lawmaker on issues like immigration and education. \nHeck is fighting former state Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, to replace longtime Democratic Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who is set to retire at the end of the year.\nThe RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Heck and Cortez Masto in a statistical dead heat, with the Nevada lawmaker holding only a 0.2 percent lead over the former attorney general.\n\nThe ad references that Heck voted four times to rescind President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders that halted the deportation of people who immigrated to the country illegally as children and of illegal immigrants who are the parents of citizens and permanent residents.\nIt then juxtaposes that with a subtitled clip of Trump declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a deportation force.\u201d\nThe ad also hits Heck for voting to cut Pell grants, and then follows it up with a clip of the Republican presidential nominee pledging  to cut the Department of Education.\n\u201cOn the issues that matter most to us, there is no difference between Joe Heck and Donald Trump,\u201d the narrator concludes in Spanish.\nWhile the ad was done by a Democratic super-PAC, Cortez Masto has had no problem comparing her rival to Trump while she\u2019s on the campaign trail.\n\u201cIt is crazy to me that in this day and age we're having this discussion about electing somebody who is full of hate and discrimination,\" Cortez Masto said. \"I have an opponent I'm running against, Congressman Heck, who is supporting him.\"\nHeck insisted such attacks won't work.\n\"People know who Joe Heck is,\" he said. \"This idea of identity politics or guilt by association, I think the electorate is smarter than that.\"\nIf Heck faces a challenge in being linked to Trump, Cortez Masto is confronting something similar in her connections to Reid, who is closely involved in her campaign and has put his still-formidable political machine behind her. Reid, 76, is a polarizing figure in the state, beloved by many Democrats but loathed by Republicans.\nCortez Masto, a cautious campaigner who has not previously faced a highly competitive race, is quick to change the topic when asked about him.\n\"Sen. Reid's not on the ballot, and to me this is a race I'm focused on about the issues that people in my state, where I was born and raised, care about, because I will be representing them in Washington, not Sen.

It also said law enforcement personnel and Border Patrol officers should have specific training in working with child victims of human trafficking.\n\"Children are coming in with very serious needs and have a precarious kind of existence while we sort out their future,\" said David Murphey, author of the Child Trends report. \"There's a bewildering array of agencies and offices that these children and families pass through.\"\nHowever, the government is not required to provide children publicly funded counsel because crossing the U.S. border without authorization or documentation is a civil offense and not a criminal one.\nIn recent years, the vast majority of children arriving as unauthorized migrants have been from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, fleeing rampant crime and gang violence, while the largest number of child refugees have been from Iraq, Burma, Somalia and Syria.\nThe Child Trends report was sent in advance to the U.S. State Department, which expressed its commitment to protecting child refugees. It cited the Central American Minors program, which allows parents lawfully in the U.S. to request that their children in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras be considered for refugee status \u2014 \"a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children have undertaken to join their parents.\"\nChild Trends, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is an independent, nonprofit organization providing research, analysis and communication to decision makers \"to improve public policies and interventions that serve children and families.\"\nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \n ", "Trump and supporters are living in a dream world.

The pauses painful and potent.\n#AndWhatisAleppo? It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home.\nAnd thus a new Twitter hashtag was born.  We should all be asking ourselves this question:  #AndWhatisAleppo?\nPerhaps it\u2019s not so surprising -- not to know. \nThe White House speaks of it only when pressed.  No one wants to go there, it\u2019s nearly impossible for reporters and aid workers, although the brave get through and we commend them.\nAleppo is the town in war torn Syria where a little boy named Omran was recently swept out of his crumbled home by an aid worker and seated in an emergency vehicle. His heartbreakingly dazed and dirty face was splashed all over the newspapers and TV screens that next day. \nSome asked if it was a picture that could turn the tide of the world\u2019s attention?  But as it turns out, it wasn\u2019t.  It was just another #Bringbackourgirls moment of sad faces and Twitter angst.\nThis week reports say 70 people were injured in #AndWhatisAleppo by chlorine bombs that were dropped from President Assad\u2019s government helicopters. Last week barrel bombs took out an estimated 16 children who were attending a funeral for others killed in this \u201copposition town\u201d as it is referred to by the Assad government.   \nBarrel bombs are improvised devices in round metal containers, containing explosives, shrapnel and sometimes chemicals.  They are crude larger IEDs, dropping from the sky, and targeting anything  unlucky enough to be in the path.  Tens of thousands of children have been slaughtered in Syria according to the U.N., so Omran was lucky to survive.  Over eight million children have been affected by the conflict. Many have nowhere to go, nowhere to live and if they are five or under like Omran, war is  all they\u2019ve ever known.\nRemember  #AssadMustGo?\nBack on Sep 6, 2013, President Obama said this. \u201cWe have been very clear to the Assad regime, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus.\u201d   \nThe line was crossed, and the only calculus that changed was Assad\u2019s.  It became clear he could defend his Alawite minority dictatorship and for now, no one was going to stop him. The world stood back as Vladimir Putin helped him crush the \u2018rebels.\u2019  \nThreatened with death, the refugee crisis began. Millions and millions of people flooded out of Syria. Like their beleaguered neighbors in Iraq and Libya many fled to Europe. Now our allies there are overburdened and scared that -- among those who ran -- are people who want to (and do) cause them harm.\nThere is a battle here at home about how many more refugees we should let into our country as well. The compassionate argument is that we must help, but it is also appropriate to ask where was the compassion in 2013, when the \u201credline\u201d was crossed?  These people wanted to live their lives and raise their families in their hometowns, but they could not.  In places like #AndWhatisAleppo, those who stayed are under siege.\n#AndWhatisAleppo?  It\u2019s a very good question. A question that prompts the squirming. It is one we must answer. It is Sarajevo, it is Bosnia, it is a village in Rwanda. It\u2019s a place we thought would go away. It is somebody\u2019s home.\nBy late Thursday morning, after his interview, Gary Johnson had issued a statement. It said in part: \"\u2026 hit with 'What about Aleppo?' I immediately was thinking about an acronym, not the Syrian conflict. I blanked. It happens, and it will happen again during the course of this campaign \u2026 Can I name every city in Syria? No. Should I have identified Aleppo? Yes. Do I understand its significance? Yes.\"\nJohnson also admitted he needs to study more and gain a better understanding.

(AP) \nMONTEVIDEO, Uruguay \u2013 A former Guantanamo prisoner on a hunger strike slipped into a coma Wednesday, said a doctor in Uruguay, where the ex-detainee was taken in as a refugee nearly two years ago but has been demanding to move elsewhere to reunite with his family. \nAbu Wa'el Dhiab was unconscious and extremely dehydrated when paramedics arrived at the apartment where he is staying in Montevideo, said Dr. Julia Galzerano of the Medical Union of Uruguay, who was treating the former prisoner from Syria. \n\"We hope that it is reversible. We can't know\" for a while, Galzerano said. The doctor said she was told Dhiab had gone 12 days without water. \nDhiab was being treated at an apartment in keeping with his wishes not to be hospitalized during his protest. \nHe drew international attention by hunger-striking during his 12 years of occasionally confrontational confinement at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was released from Guantanamo in December 2014 but could not return to his homeland and was allowed to resettle in Uruguay. \nDhiab has grown increasingly disgruntled in the South American country and launched the hunger strike to pressure the government to allow him to join his family in Turkey or to go to another country. \nChristian Mirza, the former prisoner's liaison with the Uruguayan government, said officials have been working \"at the highest levels\" to find another country to accept him. \nThe 45-year-old Syrian was one of six freed Guantanamo prisoners taken in by Uruguay as a humanitarian gesture by then President Jose Mujica. While the others settled in, Dhiab has struggled. He announced in a Sept. 6 video that he had been on hunger strike at that point for 23 days and that he had taken nothing but water over the preceding five days. His weight was not publicly known. \nAt Guantanamo, where he was detained as an enemy combatant with suspected ties to militants but never charged, his weight dropped at one point to about 155 pounds (70) kilograms, gaunt for a man over 6 feet tall (183 centimeters). Authorities there said he often struggled with guards, who forcibly removed him from his cell at least 48 times in less than a single year of his protest. Troops also said he assaulted them with feces and vomit several times. \nIn Uruguay, Dhiab has stayed out of the public eye recently, protected by activists from several generally anti-government groups who have taken up his cause. \nJon Eisenberg, a California lawyer who represented Dhiab in the past, said he had not spoken with him since Aug. 31 and was unable to get direct information. \n\"I have no doubt that he is quite ill and in despair, but I fear that the people now surrounding him are exploiting his personal despair in pursuit of their own political agenda and are not acting in his best interest,\" Eisenberg said. \nIt was the latest turn in the case of a man who has become an international headache for Uruguay's government. \nLess than two months after his arrival in Uruguay, Dhiab turned up in neighboring Argentina, in violation of an agreement not to travel, and denounced the U.S. failure to close Guantanamo. He appeared in a mock orange prison jumpsuit, an icon of the prison that was opened in 2002 to hold suspected enemy combatants in the war against al-Qaida and the Taliban following the 9/11 terrorist attack. \nDhiab then began publicly complaining about life in Uruguay, to the increasing irritation of the government, and protesting outside the U.S. Embassy, angering members of Congress. In July, he set off alarms when he vanished for several weeks, then turned up in Venezuela, which rejected his request to be sent to Turkey to join his wife and children and sent him back to Uruguay. \nAmbassador Lee Wolosky, the U.S. special envoy for Guantanamo closure, expressed bewilderment Wednesday about Dhiab's situation, saying Uruguay's government had been in \"very advanced stages\" of bringing his wife and children from Turkey when he took off to Venezuela. \n\"I think that Dhiab has been offered every opportunity by the government of Uruguay to move on with his life and he has disgracefully repudiated the extraordinary hospitality and generosity of the government of Uruguay,\" Wolosky said in an interview with The Associated Press. \nThe envoy pointed out the former prisoner had agreed to the resettlement offer and said Uruguay provided him with a $500 monthly stipend and an apartment and offered language and vocational classes. The resettlement of the other five has been a \"success,\" in contrast with Dhiab, he said. \n\"He has gotten more support than refugees receive in that country in the normal course by far and he has received more support than many Uruguayan citizens receive,\" Wolosky said. \"He's had every opportunity to make good choices and be reunited with his family and he has instead made bad choices.\" Advertisement ", "By Greg Gutfeld \nPublished September 12, 2016 FoxNews.com     \nFifteen years ago and a day, America grew up.  We were splashed with the cold water realization that an ideology exists that threatens our existence.\nIslamists weren't \"over there\" any more. Yes, they were over there -- but now, they are over here, and, all around. Sure, we knew they existed before 9/11, but we hardly paid attention, even when they hit the WTC the first time. \nWhen people ask me what my politics are, I often say conservative libertarian -- but I'm really a \"survivatarian\".  My belief system is predicated on the goal of preserving our country. I don't want to see this place go down the tubes. And I don't want a bunch of lonely losers blowing us up in the name of some god.\nBut I also call myself a \"luckatarian\" -- in that I'm aware that I am lucky to live in this country. I realize that America is not the rule, but the exception, on this brutal planet. There are so many parts of the world that are steeped in misery.  So I am lucky I was born here, and I wish others to share in that luck - long after I'm dead. This is why so many people are dying to come here  -- this is the land of the lucky. \nWhen people ask me what my politics are, I often say conservative libertarian -- but I'm really a \"survivatarian\". My belief system is predicated on the goal of preserving our country. I don't want to see this place go down the tubes. And I don't want a bunch of lonely losers blowing us up in the name of some god.\nBeing a survivatarian/luckaterian  informs my views on immigration in two ways.\n1. Being a luckatererian means I have no right to deny a decent person a wish to come and live here. It is not my right to give. If you were born here, you didn't join a club with special privileges. You were simply, lucky. You could have been born in Zimbabwe, Aleppo, or Liberia. But nope - you're here. And if i were born there, I'd do everything possible to get here. Stat.\nThere is absolutely no explanation for you being where you are born, other than your good, or bad, luck.  In those months preceding your conception, there was no location machine that allowed you  to choose San Mateo, San Clemente or San Juan as your destination of birth. You didn't choose your parents either. So if you got two of them, and they turned out well -- you're especially lucky. It's no achievement on your or my part, however. It's all a gift.\nTherefore, this means I am not a bouncer for America - I can't tell people who are not as lucky as me \"sorry, dude, that's the breaks -- go back to your hellhole and watch your children die.\"  That's akin to a lottery winner announcing that only lottery winners get to play the lottery. Only worse.\n2. So everything above is entirely correct, if -- and only if -- radical Islam did not exist.  Radical Islam is the deadly skunk at the garden party - ruining any potential for an open border. An open border is akin to leaving our door wide open in a forest of  hungry tigers. So as the lucky man, I can't just say, \"come on in,\" knowing all of our luck will run out if you happen to be an Islamist who wants to end this world.\nWhat America was supposed to be -- a beacon of freedom for the tired and weary -- is challenged, as long as there are jihadists trying to get in. They ruined that ideal. As a survivatarian, I know that as much as I want the tired and weary to come here, there's a predator hiding among them.  We need to sift.\n\"Tired and weary\" -- we understand that phrase. The world is nothing but billions of the \"tired and weary.\"  But what if people who come here under the guise of being \"tired and weary\" bring values and beliefs that serve to create only more exhaustion and pain? And, ultimately, our destruction?  Yes, bring us your tired and weary, but embrace our values.\nRadical Islam is a predator whose goal is to disable the host, dismantle its culture (or what's left of it), and not simply punish the nonbelievers, but also fellow Muslims through enforcement of an archaic brutal system.\nIt's a mistake to cast immigration issue as a Mexico thing. There is no Mexican ISIS.  No: it's about the spread of jihadism. Even if ISIS dies, a new strain of hate will replace it. And it will be Islamist, and it will be more refined, and more adept at targeting us. The next big attack will exceed the casualties of 9/11 by a factor of ten. Technological progress affects all arenas -- including the purveyors of death. Drones, plus anthrax, over a stadium, equals unimaginable horror. \nWho would do such a thing? The same people who pulled off 9/11. Now they just have better tools.\nSo while I'm aware of how lucky I am to be here, I'm also aware of how this luck is now on shaky ground. \nThe environment that we consider lucky to be living in, must be preserved -- or ultimately whatever brings such luck will be destroyed.\n\nGreg Gutfeld currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Greg Gutfeld Show (Saturdays 10-11PM/ET) and co-host of The Five (weekdays 5-6PM/ET) .

This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistribu \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2013 A selection of issues at stake in the presidential election and their impact on Americans, in brief: \nIRAN \nLast year's nuclear deal with Tehran has removed for now the threat of a U.S.-Iranian military confrontation. But the deal rests on shaky ground. \nThe accord curtailed Iran's nuclear program, pulling it back from atomic weapons capability in exchange for the end of many economic sanctions. \nBut the next president could have his or her hands full, dealing with Iran in general and the agreement in particular. Various restrictions on Iran start ending in about seven years. \nFor Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it's basically a question of continuity versus change. \nAs secretary of state, Clinton helped lay the groundwork for the pact. She supports it, while taking a generally tougher tone on Iran than President Barack Obama. \nTrump hates the deal. But he contends that he can renegotiate its terms. \nBoth are prepared to use force to prevent Tehran from acquiring the bomb. If the deal collapses or expires without sufficient safeguards, that possibility is back in play. \n___ \nREFUGEES \nWith millions of Syrians displaced by a yearslong war and hundreds of thousands of people fleeing to Europe, countries around the world are being pressed to help resettle people seeking refuge. \nThe United States pledged to accept 10,000 such refugees by the end of the budget year in September and did so, a month early. \nRepublicans have balked at the idea of allowing people from Syria into the United States and Donald Trump has called for a halt on refugee resettlement for them. He says vetting of these refugees is inadequate. \nHillary Clinton has pledged to expand the Syrian refugee program and allow as many as 65,000 such refugees into the United States. \nThe fate of the program almost certainly hinges on the outcome of the November election. \n___ \nCHILD CARE/PAY EQUITY \nIn much of the U.S., families spend more on child care for two kids than on housing. And if you're a woman, it's likely you earn less than your male colleagues. That's according to the latest research, which suggests that while the U.S. economy has improved, women and their families are still struggling to make the numbers work. \nClinton wants a 12-week government-paid family and medical leave program, guaranteeing workers two-thirds of their wages up to a certain amount. Trump proposes six weeks of leave for new mothers, with the government paying wages equivalent to unemployment benefits. Both candidates propose tax relief for child care costs. Trump's plan provides for a new income tax deduction for child care expenses, other tax benefits and a new rebate or tax credit for low-income families. Clinton says no family should spend more than 10 percent of its income on child care and has called for child-care subsidies and tax relief offered on a sliding scale. \nClinton also favors forcing businesses to disclose gender pay data to the government for analysis. Trump says only that working moms should be \"fairly compensated.\" \nWomen comprise about 57 percent of the labor force and many of them have young children. If they aren't getting paid enough to make ends meet, more families will seek out government aid programs or low-quality, unlicensed daycares for their children. \n___ \nEDUCATION \nEducation is a core issue not just for students and families, but for communities, the economy, and the nation as a global competitor. \nThe country has some 50 million K-12 students. Teaching them, preparing them for college and careers, costs taxpayers more than $580 billion a year, or about $11,670 per pupil per year. A better education usually translates into higher earnings. \nAnd while high school graduations are up sharply and dropout rates down, the nation has a ways to go to match the educational outcomes elsewhere. American schoolchildren trail their counterparts in Japan, Korea, Germany, France and more. \nFor students seeking higher education, they face rising college costs and many are saddled with debt. \nHillary Clinton has proposed free tuition at in-state public colleges and universities for working families with incomes up to $125,000 \u2014 free for families, that is, not for taxpayers. Donald Trump has focused on school choice, recently proposing to spend $20 billion in his first year in office to expand programs that let low-income families send their children to the local public, private, charter or magnet school that they think is best. \n___ \nIMMIGRATION \nThe future of millions of people living in the U.S. illegally could well be shaped by the presidential election. The stakes are high, too, for those who employ them, help them fit into neighborhoods, or want them gone. \nRepublican Donald Trump at first pledged to deport the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Not only that, he'd build a wall all along the Mexican border. But his position has evolved. He's sticking to his vow to build the wall and make Mexico pay. But he's no longer proposing to deport people who have not committed crimes beyond their immigration offences. Still, he's not proposing a way for people living in the country illegally to gain legal status. \nDemocrat Hillary Clinton, in contrast, would overhaul immigration laws to include a path to citizenship, not just legal status. \nIllegal immigration has been at nearly 40-year lows for several years. It even appears that Mexican migration trends have reversed, with more Mexicans leaving the U.S. than arriving. Billions of dollars have been spent in recent years to build fencing, improve border technology and expand the Border Patrol. \nNonetheless the Mexican border remains a focal point for those who argue that the country is not secure. \n___ \nCLIMATE CHANGE \nIt's as if Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton live on two entirely different Earths: one warming, one not. Clinton says climate change threatens us all, while Trump repeatedly tweets that global warming is a hoax. \nMeasurements and scientists say Clinton's Earth is much closer to the warming reality. And it is worsening. \nThe world is on pace for the hottest year on record, breaking marks set in 2015, 2014, and 2010. It is about 1.8 degrees warmer than a century ago. \nBut it's more than temperatures. Scientists have connected man-made climate change to deadly heat waves, droughts and flood-inducing downpours. \nStudies say climate change is raising sea levels, melting ice and killing coral. It's making people sicker with asthma and allergies and may eventually shrink our bank accounts. \nThe American Association for the Advancement of Sciences says warming can be highly damaging to people and the planet and potentially irreversible. \n___ \nROLE OF GOVERNMENT \nIt's the Goldilocks conundrum of American politics: Is the government too big, too small or just right? Every four years, the presidential election offers a referendum on whether Washington should do more or less. \nDonald Trump favors cutting regulation and has promised massive tax cuts, but his plans are expected to add trillions to the national debt. Unlike most conservatives, he supports eminent domain and has spoken positively about government-run health care. And don't forget that massive border wall. Hillary Clinton has vowed new spending on education and infrastructure that could grow government, too. She strongly supports \"Obamacare,\" which most small government proponents see as overreach. \nAt its heart, the debate about government's reach pits the desire to know your basic needs will be cared for against the desire to be left alone. For the last few decades, polls have found Americans generally feel frustrated by the federal government and think it's wasteful. A smaller government sounds good to a lot of people until they're asked what specific services or benefits they are willing to do without. \n___ \nDEBT \nThe federal government is borrowing about one out of seven dollars it spends and steadily piling up debt. Over the long term, that threatens the economy and people's pocketbooks. \nMost economists say rising debt risks crowding out investment and forcing interest rates up, among other problems. At the same time, rapidly growing spending on federal health care programs like Medicare and the drain on Social Security balances caused by the rising tide of baby boomers could squeeze out other spending, on roads, education, the armed forces and more. \nIt takes spending cuts, tax increases or both to dent the deficit. Lawmakers instead prefer higher spending and tax cuts. \nNeither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump has focused on the debt. \nTrump has promised massive tax cuts that would drive up the debt and he's shown little interest in curbing expensive benefit programs like Medicare. \nClinton, by contrast, is proposing tax increases on the wealthy. But she wouldn't use the money to bring down the debt. Instead, she'd turn around and spend it on college tuition subsidies, infrastructure and health care. \n___ \nTRADE \nIn this angry election year, many American voters are skeptical about free trade \u2014 or hostile to it. \nThe backlash threatens a pillar of U.S. policy: The United States has long sought global trade. \nEconomists say imports cut prices for consumers and make the U.S. more efficient. \nBut unease has simmered, especially as American workers faced competition from low-wage Chinese labor. Last year, the U.S. ran a $334 billion trade deficit with China \u2014 $500 billion with the entire world. \nThe Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are both playing to public suspicions about trade deals. Hillary Clinton broke with President Barrack Obama by opposing an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that she had supported as secretary of state. \nDonald Trump vows to tear up existing trade deals and to slap huge tariffs on Chinese imports. \nBut trade deals have far less impact on jobs than forces such as automation and wage differences between countries. Trump's plans to impose tariffs could start a trade war and raise prices. \n___ \nSUPREME COURT \nThe ideological direction of the Supreme Court is going to tip one way or the other after the election. The outcome could sway decisions on issues that profoundly affect everyday Americans: immigration, gun control, climate change and more. \nThe court has been operating with eight justices since Antonin Scalia died in February. His successor appears unlikely to be confirmed until after the election, at the earliest. The court is split between four Democratic-appointed, liberal justices and four conservatives who were appointed by Republicans \u2014 although Justice Anthony Kennedy has sided with the liberals on abortion, same-sex marriage and affirmative action in the past two years. \nThe ninth justice will push the court left or right, depending on whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump becomes president. President Barack Obama has nominated Merrick Garland to take Scalia's seat, but the Republican Senate has refused to consider Garland's nomination, in an effort to prevent a liberal court majority. \n___ \nCHINA \nTensions have been rising over China's assertive behavior in the seas of Asia. The U.S. also accuses China of unfair trading practices and cyber theft of business secrets. \nDonald Trump says that the sheer volume of trade gives the U.S. leverage over China. He accuses China of undervaluing its currency to make its exports artificially cheap and proposes tariffs as high as 45 percent on Chinese imports if Beijing doesn't change its behavior. Such action could risk a trade war that would make many products in the U.S. more expensive. \nClinton says the U.S. needs to press the rising Asian power to play by international rules, whether on trade or territorial disputes. \nWhile many of China's neighbors are unnerved by its military build-up, the wider world needs the U.S. and China to get along, to tackle global problems. The U.S. and China are also economically inter-dependent, and punishment by one party could end up hurting the other. \n___ \nINCOME INEQUALITY \nIncome inequality has surged near levels last seen before the Great Depression. The average income for the top 1 percent of households climbed 7.7 percent last year to $1.36 million, according to tax data. That privileged sliver of the population saw pay climb at almost twice the rate of income growth for the other 99 percent, whose pay averaged a humble $48,768. \nDogged on the issue during the primaries by Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton has highlighted inequality in multiple speeches. She hopes to redirect more money to the middle class and impoverished. Clinton would raise taxes on the wealthy, increase the federal minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, provide universal pre-K and offer the prospect of tuition-free college. \nDonald Trump offers a blunter message about a system \"rigged\" against average Americans. To bring back jobs, Trump has promised new trade deals with better terms, greater infrastructure spending than Clinton foresees and tax cuts that he says would propel stronger growth (though independent analysts say his budget plans would raise deficits). \n___ \nOPIOID EPIDEMIC \nMore than 28,000 Americans died from overdosing on opioids in 2014, a record high for the nation. \nThat's 78 people per day, a number that doesn't include the millions of family members, first responders and even taxpayers who feel the ripple of drug addiction in their daily lives. \nA rise in prescription painkillers is partially to blame: The sale of these drugs has quadrupled since 1999, and so has the number of Americans dying from an addiction to them. When prescriptions run out, people find themselves turning to the cheaper alternative heroin and, increasingly, the even more deadly drug fentanyl. \nRecovering addicts and their family members are increasingly speaking out, putting a face on drug addiction and lessening the stigma surrounding it. But dollars for prevention, treatment and recovery services are still hard to come by, leaving many people waiting weeks or months to find the treatment they're seeking. Meantime, family members empty bank accounts in search of help, while law enforcement officers and emergency rooms serve as a first line of defense. \nDonald Trump says the wall he wants to build along the southern border is essential to stopping the flow of illegal drugs into the country. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, pledges to spend $10 billion to increase access to prevention, treatment and recovery services, among other things. \n___ \nNORTH KOREA \nPariah state North Korea could soon be capable of targeting America with nuclear weapons. What can the U.S. do to stop it? \nDiplomacy and economic sanctions have not worked so far. North Korea's isolation is deepening, but it has continued to conduct nuclear test explosions and make advances in its missile technology. \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump says the U.S. can put more pressure on China to rein in its North Korean ally. He says he is willing to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. \nDemocrat Hillary Clinton wants the world to intensify sanctions as the Obama administration did with Iran, a course that eventually opened the way for a deal to contain its nuclear program. \nBut it will be tough to force North Korea back to negotiations that aim at its disarmament in exchange for aid. Kim views atomic weapons as a security guarantee for his oppressive regime \n___ \nHEALTH CARE \nAbout 9 in 10 Americans now have health insurance, more than at any time in history. But progress is incomplete, and the future far from certain. Rising costs could bedevil the next occupant of the White House. \nMillions of people previously shut out have been covered by President Barack Obama's health care law. No one can be denied coverage anymore because of a pre-existing condition. But \"Obamacare\" remains divisive, and premiums for next year are rising sharply in many communities. \nWhether Americans would be better off trading for a GOP plan is another question. A recent study found that Donald Trump's proposal would make 18 million people uninsured. GOP congressional leaders have a more comprehensive approach, but key details are still missing. \nOverall health care spending is trending higher again, and prices for prescription drugs \u2014 new and old \u2014 are a major worry. \nMedicare's insolvency date has moved up by two years \u2014 to 2028. \nHillary Clinton would stay the course, adjusting as needed. Republicans are united on repealing Obama's law, but it's unclear how they would replace it. \n___ \nAMERICA AND THE WORLD \nHow the U.S. uses its influence as the world's sole superpower is a central feature of presidential power. \nIt can mean taking the country to war \u2014 to protect the homeland or to defend an ally. Or it can mean using diplomacy to prevent war. It can affect U.S. jobs, too, as choices arise either to expand trade deals or to erect barriers to protect U.S. markets. \nIn the contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, America's role in the world is a point of sharp differences. Each says the U.S. must be the predominant power, but they would exercise leadership differently. Trump calls his approach \"America first,\" meaning alliances and coalitions would not pass muster unless they produced a net benefit to the U.S. Clinton sees international partnerships as essential tools for using U.S. influence and lessening the chances of war. \nThese divergent views could mean very different approaches to the military fight and ideological struggle against the Islamic State, the future of Afghanistan and Iraq, the contest with China for influence in Asia and the Pacific, and growing nervousness in Europe over Russian aggression. \n___ \nVOTING RIGHTS \nVoting rights in America are in flux. Republican-controlled legislatures are tightening voter laws, placing limits on early voting and same-day registration, and imposing new requirements for IDs at polling places. In 2013, the Supreme Court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That provision had required states with a history of racial discrimination to get federal preclearance to change election laws. \nThe issue has become highly partisan with the rapid growth of minority populations, which in recent presidential elections have tilted heavily Democratic. \nThe Obama Justice Department has challenged voter ID and other laws, saying they could restrict access for minorities and young people. Recent lower court rulings temporarily softened some of the toughest restrictions, but litigation remains knotted up with Supreme Court appeals likely. Bills in Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act are stalled. \nDonald Trump opposes same-day voter registration, backing laws to ensure only citizens vote. Hillary Clinton wants Congress to restore the Voting Rights Act and seeks a national standard of at least 20 days of early in-person voting. \nLike us on Facebook ", "  Fox News Latino FILE - In this Sept. 1, 2016 file photo, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Wilmington, Ohio.

All rights reserved. \nHOUSTON (AP) \u2013   Donald Trump, who has made a hard-line stance on immigration a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, asserted Saturday that \"not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders.\"\n\"All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat because the government abandoned its duty and has not enforced its basic laws,\" the Republican presidential nominee told a gathering of the Remembrance Project, a group founded to remember those killed by people living illegally in the U.S. and to press for tougher laws. \"This has to end. This will end if I become president.\"\nTwo dozen members of the organization sat behind Trump as he spoke, and several told their stories, often gruesome, of how their loved ones lost their lives. Trump has appeared with members of the group several times, including during the speech to lay out his immigration policy in Arizona last month. He vowed to continue to \"shine a national spotlight\" on their work.\n\"Politicians ignore your cries, but I never will,\" Trump said.\nMaria Espinoza, founder of the group and daughter of a Mexican immigrant, praised Trump's advocacy. But the Houston-based group has come under scrutiny for some of its pronouncements, including Espinoza's false assertion that immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally kill 25 Americans a day.\nTrump has long talked tough on immigration, deriding Mexico as a source of rapists and criminals in his campaign kick-off speech last year and vowing to build an impenetrable wall on the nation's southern border. He is not proposing a pathway to legal status for people living in the country illegally but has backed away from his call for the mass deportation of millions of people who have not committed crimes beyond their immigration offenses. But he also ruled out what he dismissed as \"amnesty,\" saying those who want to live legally in the U.S. will need to leave and head to the back of the line in their home countries.\nLater Saturday, Trump hit back at the former defense secretary who called the Republican nominee \"beyond repair\" when it comes to national security.\nRobert Gates, who served under presidents of both parties, wrote in The Wall Street Journal Saturday that Trump is \"stubbornly uninformed\" about the world. Trump, at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, called Gates \"an absolute clown,\" insinuated that \"probably has a problem we don't know about\" and then claimed that he would be \"so much better at what he's doing\" than the former Cabinet member.\nBut Trump made no mention Saturday of either controversy that dominated the political world a day earlier: he did not address his decision to finally acknowledge that President Barack Obama was born in the United States or his call for Hillary Clinton's Secret Service agents to drop their guns and then \"let's see what happens.\"\nTrump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, released a two-page letter from his doctor Saturday vouching for his \"excellent\" health, summarizing his medical history and results of a July physical exam. Pence, 57, released the letter after Trump, Democrat Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Tim Kaine, also provided some details of their medical history. The health of the candidates has become an issue since Clinton stumbled at a 9/11 memorial event and revealed afterward that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia.\nPence's doctor disclosed that Pence had basal cell carcinomas \u2014 skin cancer \u2014 removed from his face in 2002 and 2010. He also had surgery in August 2015 to repair a hernia. The doctor said the only medication Pence takes is Claritin for seasonal allergies, he does not smoke or drink alcohol, has diet-controlled heartburn and exercises four times a week.\nPence campaigned Saturday in The Villages, a sprawling retirement community northwest of Orlando, before tailgating with Florida Gators fans before their game against North Texas.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "what we don't know\u2026so much of the ocean floor is unknown. whats amazing is how few of people care or that want to even go explore it. its like a alien world, you would think we would want too.

I was in pain and I had to go through all that just to get medication,\" he told The Associated Press, declining to give his name to protect his privacy. \"I've done everything I can and just because of that law I can't live a normal life like everyone else. I just hate it.\"\nThe male gender and female name on his driver's license are the result of dissonance between state and federal rules.\nThe Indiana man was granted permission in 2013 to live and work legally in the U.S. under a federal government program that shields immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. At the same time, his gender was changed to male on all his U.S. government documents based on his diagnosis of gender dysphoria, in which a person feels extreme distress because of a disconnect between their birth sex and gender identity, his attorneys said. He used those documents to get an Indiana driver's license indicating he is male, but he can't change his name on the license because he needs a state court order, which Indiana won't grant because of its law.\nThe only similar state law is in North Dakota, which requires anyone seeking a name change to be a citizen or a permanent resident, said Shawn Meerkamper, an attorney for the Transgender Law Center, which filed the suit Sept. 13 on the Indiana man's behalf.\nIndiana's attorney general's office declined to comment on the suit, saying it would review the complaint \"and file a response in court at the appropriate time.\"\nThe man, who's married to a woman who is a U.S. citizen, takes hormones that have deepened his voice and given him a more masculine appearance. He won asylum last year as \"a protective step\" in case he were deported to Mexico, where he could face persecution for being transgender, said Thomas Saenz, general counsel for the Los Angeles-based Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined his lawsuit.\nSaenz said the man expects to apply for permanent U.S. residency this month, but will still face at least a 3-year wait before that's approved.\nHiroshi Motomura, a law professor at UCLA who studies immigration and citizenship law, said Indiana's law is \"very vulnerable\" to the legal challenge because the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that states cannot treat U.S. citizens and permanent residents differently.\n\"And when someone gets asylum, they are on a normal track to getting permanent residency,\" he said.\nThe author of Indiana's law, former Democratic state Rep. Dave Cheatham, said he would support amending it to avoid difficulties for immigrants who \"have legal status and want to change their name.\"\nTransgender advocates say a growing number of foreign-born people are asking the U.S. to grant them asylum because of fears of LGBT persecution in their country of origin.\nThe New York-based advocacy group Immigration Equality put 366 foreign-born LGBT people into the asylum application process last year \u2014 more than double the 179 cases it handled in 2010. The group has about 600 open asylum cases for LGBT and HIV-positive people, said its executive director, Aaron C.

(AP) \nSAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Two Indonesian fishermen who escaped slavery aboard a Honolulu-based tuna and swordfish vessel when it docked at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf are suing the boat's owner for tricking them into accepting dangerous jobs they say they weren't allowed to leave. \nAttorneys for Abdul Fatah and Sorihin, who uses one name, say in a lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday that they were recruited in Indonesia seven years ago to work in Hawaii's commercial fishing fleet without realizing they would never be allowed onshore. They have since been issued visas for victims of human trafficking and are living in the San Francisco area. \nThe lawsuit alleges that San Jose, California, resident Thoai Nguyen, owner and captain of the Sea Queen II, forced Sorihin and Fatah to work up to 20-hour shifts, denied them medical treatment and demanded thousands of dollars if they wanted to leave before their contracts expired. Nguyen did not return calls seeking comment. \nThe lawsuit seeks payment for debts the men incurred, fees they paid and compensation promised without specifying a dollar amount, and asks for unspecified damages for \"mental anguish and pain.\" \n\"I want to be compensated because of the suffering I felt on the boat and all the suffering I have endured after I got off the boat,\" Sorihin said Thursday through a translator at his lawyer's San Francisco office. \"And I hope no one will suffer what I have suffered.\" \nThe lawsuit comes two weeks after an Associated Press investigation found around 140 fishing boats based in Honolulu, including Sea Queen II, were crewed by hundreds of men from impoverished Southeast Asia and Pacific Island nations. The seafood is sold at markets and upscale restaurants across the U.S. A legal loophole allows them to work without visas as long as they don't set foot on shore. The system is facilitated by the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as Customs and Border Protection who require boat owners to hold workers' passports. \nAP found some men are paid as little as 70 cents an hour. Others had to use buckets instead of toilets, suffered running sores from bed bugs or sometimes lacked sufficient food. \nIn response, the Hawaii Longline Association representing fishing boat owners has created a universal crew contract that will be required on any boat wanting to sell fish in the state's seafood auction starting Oct. 1. The group says it deplores human trafficking, and that the contract will protect workers. \nThe contracts let owners continue to set their own minimum salaries, allow workers to spend the entire year at sea (15 trips, 10 to 40 days each), and reiterate that they must remain on board with passports held by owners. \nCornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr said the new contract \"reinforces the current deplorable situation by emphasizing that the crew members have no real rights.\" \n\"Congress should repeal the loophole that exempts U.S. fishing captains from having to provide basic labor protections to their crew,\" he said. \nHere's what Sorihin and Fatah say happened to them. \nThey signed contracts promising $350 a month plus bonuses. They borrowed about $300 to pay an agent in Jakarta. They flew from Jakarta to Singapore, then Sydney, on to Fiji and Pago Pago, American Samoa, an exhausting, 12,500-mile trip. \nBecause docking is inconvenient and potentially costly, the fishermen had to swim from one boat to another before sailing to Honolulu to begin fishing. \nThen it got worse. \nOne day as Sorihin wrestled a shark onto the Sea Queen, a fishing line got wrapped around his finger, nearly breaking it off. He said his captain set it straight with a chopstick, rubbing ginger and honey on it. \nAnother time a winch cable snapped, cracking Sorihin in his shoulder; swollen and sore, he was allowed a two-hour rest. A swordfish sliced his face as he pulled it aboard, according to the lawsuit. \nThey say the captain was verbally abusive and gave them only torn and worn-out gear. There was new protective gear on the boat but the captain said they would have to pay for it. Both men asked to see a doctor at various times but were told there was no health insurance. \n\"I knew if I stayed on that boat I was going to die,\" said Sorihin in an interview. \nThey worked from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. without a food break. Then, after a meal and a few hours' rest, they'd fish some more. After a few trips, three relatives of the captain's joined them as crew. \n\"The captain's nephew kicked me with his feet to wake me up. I never felt safe working on that boat,\" Fatah said in an interview. \nAlthough there was a toilet on board, they had to go to the bathroom in plastic buckets and baggies on deck. And the money, a few hundred dollars a month, just wasn't worth it. \nAfter a few 20-day trips out of Hawaii, they began docking in San Francisco about once a month. They would gaze from Fisherman's Wharf dock over to Scoma's, a classic San Francisco seafood restaurant where diners enjoyed the freshest catch. \nThen they'd head out to sea again. One day Fatah got washed onto a railing by a huge wave. He shivered, cried and cramped up. \"I thought, 'This is probably the end,'\" he said. \nThey asked to go home, but were told they would have to reimburse the captain the $6,000 he spent to bring them there. \nFinally, they decided to run. It was before dawn, six years ago, when the skipper was gone and drunken crewmembers slept. Sorihin and Fatah sneaked into a private room and grabbed their passports. They dashed through San Francisco's historic waterfront and eventually boarded a southbound train toward San Jose, where they sought help from an Indonesian man they knew of. \n\"I didn't think I'd have another chance to survive at sea,\" said Fatah. \"I was really afraid.\" \nThe man took them in and found them help, through the Catholic Church, a shelter, social workers and eventually immigration attorneys. \nToday they both work two jobs. They clerk at a liquor store, and Sorihin also drives a car for hire. Fatah takes inventory at a department store. Neither goes anywhere near Fisherman's Wharf. \nEarlier this year, before filing their lawsuit, they looked at photos of the Sea Queen II and their former captain. \n\"That's him,\" said Sorihin, shaking his head when asked if he would take a short walk to see the boat. \"I'm afraid of this man.\" Advertisement", "By Gustavo Torres \n  Fox News Latino Colombia\u2019s President Juan Manuel Santos, front left, and the top commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Rodrigo Londono, known by the alias Timochenko, shake hands after signing the peace agreement between Colombia\u2019s government and the FARC to end over 50 years of conflict in Cartagena, Colombia, Monday, Sept. 26, 2016.

This peace accord \u2013 pending ratification by the Colombian people in a plebiscite next month \u2013 will bring half a century of fighting to an end.    \nHowever, despite this momentous success, significant challenges remain. At this critical moment, we hope the U.S. government will come together to ensure that America is committed to helping Colombia secure peace and to providing assistance to Colombia as the government begins the difficult work of implementing this historic agreement.  \nWe also write to express our renewed commitment to ensuring that the United States remains a steadfast partner as you implement this landmark accord. If ratified by the Colombian people next month, the peace agreement will bring an end to the longest running conflict in our hemisphere.  As you know, Colombians of all walks of life have suffered over half a century of fighting, which has claimed more than 220,000 lives and displaced over 6 million people. This accord \u2013 the product of four years of painstaking negotiations \u2013 will help to reintegrate former combatants into society and promote security and economy opportunity in rural areas plagued by violence.  \nWe strongly encourage the Colombian government and all relevant parties to ensure that it is carried out in a manner that promotes the rights of victims of all armed actors and honors their demands for truth and justice. We also welcome the inclusion of provisions on Afro\u2010Colombian and indigenous rights and urge their full implementation.            \nFor these reasons and recognizing the serious challenges that Colombia will face in implementing the agreement, we strongly support the Peace Colombia initiative announced in February. We also believe that this commitment must be honored by our next Administration.\nAfter standing with Colombia through decades of war, we must continue to stand with the Colombian people as you work to build a just and lasting peace.      \nAgain, we want to congratulate all the parties engage in this historic milestone. This progress is indicative not only of the Colombian government\u2019s commitment to peace, but also of the Colombian people\u2019s remarkable capacity for healing and forgiveness.  \nWe look forward to continuing to support Colombia at this momentous time in your nation\u2019s history.\nGustavo Torres is a Maryland resident originally from Colombia. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Trump to meet with South Florida Latinos in 1st post-debate campaign stop Published September 27, 2016 Fox News Latino (Photo by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) \nComing off his first presidential debate, in which the Republican nominee received mixed reviews, Donald Trump is taking his campaign to Florida on Tuesday in an attempt to woo over Latino voters in the key battleground state. \nIn his first public appearance since the debate, Trump is expected to meet with 150 South Florida Latinos during a town hall-style meeting at Miami Dade College\u2019s Koubek Center. \nTrump had twice previously attempted to meet with Hispanics from Miami but both times the meetings had to be canceled \u2013 the first because of the Dallas police shootings and the second time because the billionaire had to meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. \nThe town hall on Tuesday underscores the importance for Trump to win over as many Latino voters as possible if he hopes to steal the Sunshine State from rival Hillary Clinton on Election Day. \nIn 2014, Latinos made up 24 percent of Florida\u2019s population and that number has grown in the last two years as more and more Puerto Ricans move to the state amid the U.S. territory\u2019s continuing economic woos. The large Cuban-American population in South Florida has for years made the Latino community a stronghold for Republicans. But as the older generation dies off and Hispanics from other parts of Latin America \u2013 Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela \u2013 move to the state, the Democrats have gained an advantage among Latinos. \nPolls show a tied race in Florida, but with Trump still trailing Clinton among Hispanics statewide. A recent survey put Trump ahead of Clinton among Florida\u2019s Cuban-Americans but by a much narrower margin than past Republican presidential nominees. \nA poll released last month by Fox News Latino found that Puerto Ricans seem to have a higher favorability for Hillary Clinton than any other Hispanic group, including Mexican-Americans \u2013 who are most affected by Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric. \nAbout 65 percent of Puerto Ricans, a group expected to play a key role in Florida, viewed Clinton favorably, while only 12 percent had the same view of Trump. The margin of error for Puerto Ricans, however, was plus or minus 8.5 percent. \nOne of Trump\u2019s main challenges in winning over Latinos in Florida is his rhetoric on immigration, which while not a pressing concern to either Cuban-Americans or Puerto Ricans is something that galvanizes the entire U.S. Latino community, experts say. \nFollowing his meeting in Miami, Trump will head to the town of Melbourne in the Republican stronghold of Brevard County. \nLike us on Facebook ", "US tried to deport refugee shot, killed by California police Published September 29, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print Police released this image of the suspect assuming a shooting stance (El Cajon Police) \nEL CAJON, Calif. \u2013 U.S. authorities tried twice to deport the unarmed black man fatally shot by police in a San Diego suburb, but his native Uganda refused to take him, resulting in his release. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement to The Associated Press that Alfred Olango stopped reporting to officers in February 2015. Spokeswoman Virginia Kice didn't know if officers tried to find him after that. \nOlango arrived as a refugee in 1991 and was ordered deported in 2002 after being convicted on drug charges. He was released under a U.S. Supreme Court ruling barring detention of foreign nationals after six months if deportation is unlikely. \nImmigration authorities took Olango into custody in 2009 after a firearms conviction in Colorado but were again unable to obtain travel documents. \nOlango, 38, was shot and killed Tuesday by police in El Cajon after pulling out a large electronic cigarette, known as a vape pen, from his pocket and pointing it at the police officer who fired, while a second officer stood nearby trying to subdue him with a stun gun, according to police. A family attorney said Olango was having an emotional breakdown over the recent death of his best friend. \nThe investigation centers on a video taken by a bystander. Police have produced a single frame from the cellphone video to support their account, saying it shows Olango in a \"shooting stance.\" \nThe photo shows Olango's hands clasped together and pointed directly at an officer who had assumed a similar posture with his gun a few feet away. \nThe vaping device in his hands had two components, a box about the size of a cellphone and a metallic cylinder that was 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Police said the cylinder was pointed right at the officer. \nOlango's relatives demanded the full video be released, according to Dan Gilleon, a lawyer who says he is representing the family. \n\"They're cherry-picking part of the video,\" Gilleon said. \"This is exactly what police have said is unfair when only portions of video are released against them.\" \nMayor Bill Wells said he had seen the video and that it was not \"tremendously complicated to figure out what happened.\" \nWells was asked how he would feel if it was his child that had been shot. \n\"I saw a man who was distraught, and a man acting like he was in great pain,\" Wells said. \"And I saw him get gunned down and killed. If he was my son, I would be devastated.\" \nOlango arrived in the U.S. years ago as a refugee from Uganda. Since then he ran afoul of the law several times: selling cocaine, driving drunk, and illegally possessing a 9mm semi-automatic handgun when he was arrested in Colorado in 2005 with pot and ecstasy in his car, according to court records. He pleaded guilty in federal court and was sentenced to nearly four years for being a felon in possession of a gun. \nThe fatal shooting happened less than two weeks after black men were shot and killed by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, where violent protests broke out. \nProtests in El Cajon Wednesday night had heated moments, but remained mostly peaceful. \nScores of people gathered quietly around candles lining a curb in front of bloodstained pavement at the strip mall where Olango was shot. \nMore than 200 people marched in the streets near the site, yelling \"no justice, no peace, no racist police!\" \nPolice in riot gear, some of them with dogs, faced off with protesters occasionally, bringing some tense moments, but mostly kept their distance. \nExperts said it was too early to conclude whether the California shooting was justified or could have been prevented. \nChuck Drago, a former Florida police chief who consults about police use of force, said that once Olango struck the shooting pose, officers would have had to react quickly if he drew an unknown object from his pocket. \n\"An officer doesn't have enough time to wait to determine if that's a gun in his hand,\" Drago said. \"If a person is pointing something at an officer and he believes it's a gun and it is a gun and that officer doesn't have his gun out, that officer will lose that gunfight.\" \nPolice have not named the officers involved, though Wells said both were 21-year veterans and one was Officer Richard Gonsalves. \nGonsalves was demoted last year after allegations that he sexually harassed a lesbian colleague. The City Council had to defend the move to angry citizens who had called for him to be fired. \nChristopher Rice-Wilson, associate director of the civil rights group Alliance San Diego, questioned why one officer felt non-lethal force was appropriate while the other did not. Both officers have been put on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, per department policy. Officials have not revealed which officer fired the shots. \nEl Cajon, a city of 100,000 people about 15 miles northeast of San Diego, has become home for many refugees fleeing Iraq and, more recently, Syria.

All rights reserved. \nFrom the border state of Arizona, in a highly-awaited speech on immigration, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reinforced the hold-no-prisoners approach to controlling the U.S. border and cracking down on those already inside without permission that helped propel him to victory during the GOP primaries.\nTrump said in no uncertain terms that he would come down hard on people who are here illegally, giving the highest priority to those who have committed crimes, but also targeting anyone here without authorization.\nAfter about two weeks of appearing to soften his stance on illegal immigration, punctuated by remarks about the damage that it does to the United States, Trump returned full-throttle to pledging to build a huge wall, to bringing back some of the most stringent federal enforcement programs, and putting 5 million people back into deportation proceedings who got a reprieve from executive orders issued by President Barack Obama.\n\u201cUnder a Trump administration, it\u2019s called America First, remember that,\u201d he said to frequent cheers from the crowd in Phoenix.\nHe said that the U.S. immigration system \u201cserves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful politicians, it does not serve you, the American people.\u201d\nIn apparent response to advocates -- and even some who support tightening the border \u2013 who want less deportation and a chance for undocumented immigrants to legalize while remaining in the country, Trump said:\n\u201cThe central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\u201d\nWith force, Trump backed into his controversial austere position on illegal immigration, after suggesting in the last two weeks that he was open to allowing people who have not run into trouble with the police and who are not national security risks to have a chance to legalize their status without leaving the U.S.\nHe ensconced himself in familiar themes \u2013 the undocumented immigrants as a terrorist threat, a killer walking American neighborhoods, a taker of jobs that should go to Americans, a usurper of public benefits.\nIt echoed the speech he delivered when he launched his campaign, promising a war on illegal immigration and saying that Mexico sends rapists and drug dealers to the U.S. Immigration also took center stage on the first day of the Republican National Convention, when it opened with speeches about immigrants who have killed Americans, and featured relatives of the victims on stage.\nLatino groups and immigration advocacy groups blasted the speech as fear-mongering and provocative.\nC\u00e9sar J. Blanco, interim director of Latino Victory Fund, said in a statement: \u201cWe have seen Donald Trump\u2019s true colors, heard his opinions of our community, and we understand his intentions to attack, demean, and hurt Latinos throughout the country.\u201d\n\u201cBut we won\u2019t be bullied into silence.

He spoke frequently about building a huge wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and spoke about dealing with undocumented immigrants already here by tracking down and expelling all of them \u2013 something that even the most hardline candidates of elections past were reluctant to do, describing it as undoable.\nHis core followers have relished such talk.\n\u201cThis evening, Donald Trump laid out a coherent and workable strategy for addressing the decades-long problem of mass illegal immigration, and for reforming our dysfunctional legal immigration policies,\" said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). \"But even more important than the details of the plan itself, Trump laid out the most fundamental principle for true immigration reform: The policy exists to protect and serve \u2018the wellbeing of the American people,\u2019 and \u2018protect all aspects of American life.\u2019\nBut Trump's tough stances have made many in the GOP nervous, and groups such as Latinos say they are furious and nervous about the possibility of a President Trump and a nation where many families in their communities would live in fear.\nHillary for America, the Democratic presidential candidate's political action committee, released a statement suggesting a President Trump would divide America. \n\"Donald Trump once again showed us that he will continue his decades-long record of divisiveness and campaign of hate by pledging to forcibly remove every single undocumented immigrant from our country, the statement said. \"He showed us, very clearly, what's at stake in this election by painting a picture of his idea of America: one in which immigrants are not welcomed and one in which innocent families are torn apart.\"\nHis poll numbers suffered among Latinos, showing an unfavorability rate that at times surpassed 80 percent, a concern in the eyes of many of Trump\u2019s supporters, given that many political experts say that a Republican presidential nominee would need at least 40 percent of the Latino vote to win.\nIn recent weeks, national polls have showed Trump and Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton in a relatively tight race, but trailing the former secretary of state in key battleground places such as Florida.\nIn a town hall with Fox News host Sean Hannity last week, Trump appeared willing to be more moderate on immigration, even saying that he would consider allowing undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes in the U.S. to pay taxes, fines and try to legalize their status without leaving the country.\nAhead of Trump\u2019s speech, the Republican National Committee released a video saying that Clinton is the one who has flip-flopped on immigration and pandered on the issue.\n\u201cClinton only prioritizes what is politically convenient for her,\" said RNC Director of Hispanic Communications Helen Aguirre Ferr\u00e9. \u201cClinton panders for political gain\u2013it\u2019s hypocrisy at its worst.

Eighty-five percent of first and second generation Latino and Asian immigrants and 74 percent of those who are third generation or greater oppose building a border wall.\n\"Having some sort of program that allows the illegal citizens to become legal citizens, I think it gives the viewpoint that the U.S. cares,\" said Juan Tavares, a 24-year-old from California whose parents were born in Mexico. \"You're going to have people who are illegal who will prove that they're loyal or they care about what this country has given to them and they would like a chance to give back.\"\nStill, Tavares, a U.S. citizen, says the United States could do more to secure its border with Mexico, including by building a wall in parts of California and Texas.\n\"Just because I'm Mexican, it doesn't mean I believe in an open border,\" he said.\nGenForward is a survey of adults age 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The first-of-its-kind poll pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color, highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new generation.\nOnly a minority of young Hispanics and Asian-Americans in the poll \u2014 27 percent and 9 percent, respectively \u2014 say both of their parents were born in the United States.\nBrad Jones, a professor at the University of California, Davis, who focuses on race, ethnicity and immigration, said the results reflect that Latino immigrants are more directly affected by the increase in deportations under President Barack Obama's administration and shifts in immigration enforcement policy. Jones also noted that while much attention is focused on Trump's stance on illegal immigration, Asian-Americans have also been \"widely tethered\" to negative rhetoric on immigration throughout the campaign.\n\"It's not a surprise that young people who are closely connected either to parents who are immigrants or who are immigrants themselves are going to be just more attuned to the negative externalities of these policies,\" Jones said.\nZoraida Ramirez, a 20-year-old Hispanic woman whose great-grandparents moved to the United States, opposes building a border wall or deporting the millions of people who live in the United States illegally, though she only somewhat supports creating a path to citizenship for them. She somewhat opposes allowing people to become U.S. citizens if they graduate from college.\n\"There are people that have worked to do it the right way and worked to do it the legal way,\" Ramirez, who lives in Connecticut, said.\nThe difference extends to politics, too. Seventy-one percent of first and second generation Asian-Americans and Latinos, but just 49 percent of those whose families have been in the United States longer, identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party. And 27 percent of third generation or later Hispanics and Asian-Americans, but just 14 percent of more recent immigrants, identify with or lean toward the Republican Party.\nFifty-nine percent of immigrants and children of immigrants, but just 34 percent of those who don't have at least one immigrant parent, have a favorable view of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Seventy-one percent of first and second generation Hispanics and Asian-Americans, but just 50 percent of those who aren't immigrants or children of immigrants, say she is qualified to be president. There's no such gap on views of Republican Donald Trump, with less than 2 in 10 among either group saying he is qualified to be president.\nRamirez, who didn't vote in the primary but said she preferred Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said she's leaning toward Clinton even though she views her somewhat unfavorably.\n\"With Trump, he's kind of a little bit too extreme for my taste, his views are so right wing,\" she said. \"He goes back on his word a lot.\"\n___\nThe poll of 1,958 adults age 18-30 was conducted August 1-14 using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population.

He remained at the apartment for treatment, in keeping with his wishes not to be hospitalized during his protest.\nA supporters' group known as Vigil for Jihad Dhiab said he began to regain consciousness after treatment with a saline solution. But it said that after regaining lucidity, he decided to remove the intravenous line.\nDhiab drew international attention through hunger strikes during his 12 years of occasionally confrontational confinement at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Released in December 2014, he could not return to his war-torn homeland and was taken in as a refugee by Uruguay along with five other freed detainees.\nWhile the others mostly stayed out of the spotlight, Dhiab grew increasingly disgruntled in this South American country.\nLess than two months after his arrival, he turned up in neighboring Argentina, and denounced the U.S. failure to close Guantanamo. U.S. officials said the trip violated an understanding he not leave the country but Uruguay has said there was no such agreement.\nHe also publicly complained about life in Uruguay, to the increasing irritation of the government, and he protested outside the U.S. Embassy. In July, he set off alarms when he vanished for several weeks, before turning up in Venezuela, which sent him back to Uruguay.\nAt some point, he began the hunger strike seeking to pressure Uruguay's government into allowing him to join his wife and children in Turkey or another nation.\nMirza said Wednesday that officials have been working \"at the highest levels\" to find another country that would accept Dhiab.\nWhile at Guantanamo, where he was detained as an enemy combatant with suspected ties to militants but was never charged, Dhiab saw his weight drop at one point to about 155 pounds, gaunt for a man over 6 feet tall. Authorities there said he often struggled with guards, who forcibly removed him from his cell at least 48 times in less than a single year of his protest. Troops also said he assaulted them with feces and vomit several times.\nAmbassador Lee Wolosky, the U.S. special envoy for Guantanamo closure, expressed bewilderment Wednesday about Dhiab's actions. He said Uruguay's government had been in \"very advanced stages\" of bringing Dhiab's wife and children from Turkey when Dhiab took off to Venezuela.\n\"I think that Dhiab has been offered every opportunity by the government of Uruguay to move on with his life and he has disgracefully repudiated the extraordinary hospitality and generosity of the government of Uruguay,\" Wolosky said in an interview with The Associated Press.\nThe envoy pointed out the former prisoner had agreed to the resettlement offer and said Uruguay provided him with a $500 monthly stipend and an apartment and offered language and vocational classes.\n\"He has gotten more support than refugees receive in that country in the normal course by far and he has received more support than many Uruguayan citizens receive,\" Wolosky said. \"He's had every opportunity to make good choices and be reunited with his family and he has instead made bad choices.\"", "Anyone see why we have immigration and deportation laws and border security standards and procedures?", "destroy the middle east to create a refugee crisis? this administration is a gift that keeps giving.", "  In this photo taken on Saturday Sept. 10, 2016, African refugees and migrants wait aboard a partially punctured rubber boat to be assisted, during a rescue operation on the Mediterranean Sea, about 13 miles North of Sabratha, Libya.

San Francisco followed and expanded what the cards could do. New York City launched the country's most ambitious program last year. \nDetroit will soon become the latest city with a municipal IDs program. \n\"I think for me it's important to emphasize it's not about immigration. It's about building inclusive democracies and removing barriers in our communities,\" said Detroit City Councilwoman Raquel Castaneda-Lopez, who helped lead the effort in her city. \nSuch programs accept many different types of documents, making it easier for immigrants, homeless people, ex-prisoners and others who might lack birth certificates or proof of residency to get IDs. Many are based on point systems allowing applicants to submit a combination of documents or cards. Those include U.S. or foreign passports, documents denoting service in the military, attendance at schools, and completion of a prison sentence or community service program. \nDetroit's IDs program, set to launch this month, follow the U.S. Supreme Court's recent deadlock on a decision effectively blocking an Obama administration plan to shield millions of immigrants living in the country illegally from deportation. \nIt also comes amid rhetoric on the presidential campaign trail, where Republican nominee Donald Trump has proposed temporarily banning foreign Muslims from entering the country and vowed to build a wall along the Mexican border. Detroit and its suburbs are home to one of the biggest Arab-American communities in the U.S., and the city has a large and growing Hispanic population. \nNadia Tonova, director of the National Network of Arab American Communities, said using the program \"sends a really strong statement\" about welcoming \"the most vulnerable\" residents. \n\"I certainly think that those types of messages are needed this year more than ever,\" said Tonova, whose network has 25 member organizations in 12 states. \nAbout 10 municipalities have ID programs and at least 12 more are seeking them, according to nonprofit advocacy groups. \nCastaneda-Lopez, the daughter of a Mexican immigrant and the first Latina elected to Detroit's city council, said the city's cards are not meant to replace state IDs or driver's licenses but can help prove residency to secure social services or apply for a job. \nThe council passed an ordinance this year to create the municipal IDs. Census data show Detroit's foreign-born population in 2014 was about 38,700, out of a total 680,000 residents. Of those, 13,600 were naturalized U.S. citizens and 25,000 were non-U.S. citizens. \nIn New Haven, officials began issuing the IDs in 2007 after immigrants who lacked government identification began to worry about their safety. Some had trouble opening bank accounts without an ID and became targets for robbers looking to steal cash. \nSome critics have accused ID programs of being a way to obtain information about residents that could be used against them. New Haven officials stress the confidentiality of their records. \nBacklash also has come from people and groups that don't think public money should be spent to help immigrants who are in the country illegally. But people involved in pushing municipal ID efforts argue that the broadening benefits add to the cards' value and attract more people to use them, even those with traditional forms of ID. \nGraciela Flores, a mother of three children from Queens, New York, got her municipal ID last year. She said she has used her card to get into the Bronx Zoo for a discounted price and looks forward to its other perks. \n\"It's accepted wherever I go,\" she said through a translator, adding that \"nobody asks me any questions.\" \nNew York City Councilman Carlos Menchaca, author and co-sponsor of that city's ID legislation, said the city has tied several benefits to the cards to make them more attractive, which has helped ensure their success. He said another plus is that New York City police accept them as valid forms of ID when making stops. \nLike us on Facebook ", "    livefyre 0 Email Print AP \nBy Stephen Dinan | The Washington Times \nIllegal immigration across the southwest border surged 10 percent in August, defying the usual pattern of a late-summer slowdown as the Obama administration struggles to keep families from pouring in from Central America.\nNearly 10,000 people traveling as families were caught last month, and some 68,080 have been caught in the first 11 months of fiscal 2016.

It sought to force the government to appoint lawyers for the children since immigration judges don't have that authority now.\nU.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly ruled that the children could pursue their claims that being denied lawyers violated their due-process rights, but three judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision. The appeals court panel said federal immigration law precludes such claims from being filed in U.S. District Court.\nInstead, the judges said, such claims must be brought individually and filed directly in federal appeals courts after deportations proceedings are exhausted.\n\"I cannot let the occasion pass without highlighting the plight of unrepresented children who find themselves in immigration proceedings,\" Judge Mary Margaret McKeown wrote in a concurrence to her own unanimous opinion for the panel. \"I write to underscore that the Executive and Congress have the power to address this crisis without judicial intervention. What is missing here? Money and resolve \u2014 political solutions that fall outside the purview of the courts.\"\nAdvocates for the children, including the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project and the American Civil Liberties Union chapters of Washington state and Southern California, said they would seek a new hearing with more judges. They say it's unreasonable to expect children who are ordered deported to then file an appeal, file briefs with arguments, obtain a final order on appeal, and then bring their case to a federal appeals court \u2014 the point at which they would be allowed to raise the issue that being deprived of a lawyer violated their rights.\n\"Unrepresented kids aren't able to go through that process. They don't have the capacity,\" said Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. \"On the one hand the judges recognize the gravity of the situation. But the court has the responsibility to resolve an issue where there's no other meaningful forum. You can't duck the matter by saying, 'Well Congress can fix this, the president can fix it.'\"\nMore than 60,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in the United States in the 2014 fiscal year, many of them fleeing violence in Central America. The numbers dipped in 2015 before jumping again this year. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the nation has a moral obligation to provide the children with lawyers for immigration proceedings, even if they aren't constitutionally entitled to one, and President Barack Obama's administration has taken some steps to improve representation, such as by spending $1.8 million on living expenses for 100 legal fellows who focus on such cases around the country.\nNevertheless, McKeown wrote, such measures are merely a drop in the bucket: Tens of thousands of children remain unrepresented.\nMcKeown suggested that eventually, cases that are properly brought will reach the appeals court, at which point judges can consider the merits of the children's claims. But in her concurrence, also signed by Judge Milan Smith Jr., she urged Congress and the president not to wait that long.\n\"The stakes are too high,\" she said.\nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally, Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016, in Colorado Springs, Colo.

The report did not identify those countries.\nDHS said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials \u2014 old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can't be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review \"every file\" identified as a case of possible fraud.\nRoth's report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants' files to add fingerprints to the digital record.\nThe gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn't consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010.\nThe government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.\nRoth's report said federal prosecutors have accepted two criminal cases that led to the immigrants being stripped of their citizenship. But prosecutors declined another 26 cases. ICE is investigating 32 other cases after closing 90 investigations.\nICE officials told auditors that the agency hadn't pursued many of these cases in the past because federal prosecutors \"generally did not accept immigration benefits fraud cases.\" ICE said the Justice Department has now agreed to focus on cases involving people who have acquired security clearances, jobs of public trust or other security credentials.\nMistakenly awarding citizenship to someone ordered deported can have serious consequences because U.S. citizens can typically apply for and receive security clearances or take security-sensitive jobs.\nAt least three of the immigrants-turned-citizens were able to acquire aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. Their credentials were revoked after they were identified as having been granted citizenship improperly, Roth said in his report.\nA fourth person is now a law enforcement officer.\nRoth recommended that all of the outstanding cases be reviewed and fingerprints in those cases be added to the government's database and that immigration enforcement officials create a system to evaluate each of the cases of immigrants who were improperly granted citizenship. DHS officials agreed with the recommendations and said the agency is working to implement the changes.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Maybe they are going to stop listening to the race batters and start looking at the facts.

Ted Cruz delivered a highly criticized speech in Cleveland at the Republican National Convention, it seemed like the Texas lawmaker would never endorse GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\nCruz, however, finally broke said on Friday on a Facebook post that he will vote for Trump on Election Day in November.\n\u201cAfter many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz wrote.\n\nIn his lengthy post, Cruz said he was voting for Trump out of party loyalty and to prevent Democrat Hillary Clinton from winning the White House.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made this decision for two reasons. First, last year, I promised to support the Republican nominee. And I intend to keep my word,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cSecond, even though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable \u2014 that\u2019s why I have always been #NeverHillary .\u201d\nCruz continued by laying out \u201csix key policy differences\u201d that led him to endorse Trump \u2013 all of which focused on Clinton\u2019s perceived shortcomings on issues such as health care, energy and national security.\nOn the topic of immigration, which has been a hot button issue this campaign, Cruz said that Trump would stop the executive actions taken by President Barack Obama, while Clinton would continue them.\n\u201cClinton would continue, and even expand, President Obama\u2019s lawless executive amnesty,\" the first-term senator wrote. \u201cTrump has promised that he would revoke those illegal executive orders.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIf Clinton wins, we know \u2014 with 100 percent certainty \u2014 that she would deliver on her left-wing promises, with devastating results for our country.\u201d\nAfter the endorsement, Trump put out a statement reading, \u201cI am greatly honored by the endorsement of Sen. Cruz. We have fought the battle, and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\u201d\nCruz\u2019s endorsement comes after months of bad blood between him and Trump in the primaries during which Cruz, Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich fought for the nomination until early May and the Indiana primary, where Trump clinched the number of delegates needed to win the nomination.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump nicknamed Cruz \"Lyin' Ted,\" and derided him as \"unstable,\" ''crazy,\" ''a maniac\" and \"sick.\"\nTrump also questioned whether Cruz's birth in Canada disqualified him to hold the office of president, threatening to sue over the issue. He never followed through, but several lawsuits were filed on the topic, including one in Cruz's home state.\nCruz initially avoided personal attacks on Trump, hoping that the former reality TV star's supporters would flow to him if Trump flamed out. As Trump's momentum grew with early primary victories, however, Cruz decided to fight back \u2013 labeling Trump a \"pathological liar\" and \"utterly amoral\" and claiming he can't be trusted because of his past support for Democratic candidates, abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\nThe two candidates also exchanged highly personal barbs after Trump tweeted out an unflattering image of Heidi Cruz along with the caption \"A picture is worth a thousand words.\"\nDuring his time in the race, Cruz also argued that he was the only truly conservative candidate running. He was aided in that effort by having clashed stubbornly in the Senate repeatedly both with Democrats and with members of his own party over ideological matters. \nCruz\u2019s endorsement seemed to signal that he is more concerned about the possibility of another Clinton in the White House than he is about holding onto any grudge against Trump.\n\u201cOur country is in crisis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans. And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.\u201d\nCruz continued, \u201cA year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don\u2019t want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.\u201d\nIn recent days, after it appeared that Cruz was leaning toward endorsing Trump, critics characterized the move as a potentially damaging flip-flop.\n\u201cThere were thousands of people not in that arena [in Cleveland] who will be utterly disappointed that Cruz didn't maintain his principled stand for conservatism,\" the Washington Examiner quoted Rick Tyler, Cruz\u2019s former campaign spokesman, as saying. \"Endorsing now for no reciprocation? He would just end up being a Trump Chump.\u201d\nOther saw a Cruz endorsement as good politics.\n\u201cTrump is our nominee, and Sen. Cruz represents a big electoral state and is very popular in Texas,\u201d said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas). \u201cIt certainly would be helpful, I think, for the Trump campaign to have Cruz\u2019s endorsement.\"\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "It was a personal choice of the parents to enter the US in violation of existing immigration laws.

But the trend reported by Google marks a large reversal from last month's registration searches, which were highest in predominantly white, Northern states \u2013 areas that typically have the highest voter turnout in presidential elections.\nThe Google search surge, however, does fit with anecdotal evidence that Trump\u2019s language \u2013 not just toward Machado, but on topics important to Latinos such as immigration \u2013 is driving more Hispanics to register to vote this election season.\n\u201cI\u2019m confident Latino voter turnout will go up significantly,\u201d Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jul\u00ed\u00e1n Castro told Fox News Latino during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \u201cWe see it in the registrations that are happening in different states. I believe it can go into the 50s, and if that happens then particularly in swing states like Florida, Colorado Nevada and even Virginia, where there is a growing Latino population, Hillary Clinton will win those.\u201d\nLatinos, however, have historically failed to show up in large numbers come Election Day.\nIn the 2012 presidential match-up between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, less than half (48 percent) of registered Latino voters cast a ballot \u2013 a figure that has remained relatively unchanged over the last four presidential elections.\n\u201cOur weakness in this country is that in the past there have been Latinos who are eligible to vote who are not registered to vote,\u201d said Democratic Rep.

The United States is the Latin American nation\u2019s largest trade partner and receives 80 percent of Mexico\u2019s exports.\nSince the start of the month, the peso has lost 4 percent of its value against the dollar even as currencies in other emerging-market have powered forward. The decline has been particularly stinging as Mexico\u2019s central bank has raised rates several times this year and is expected to do so again when officials meet Thursday\nCameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR Global, a Massachusetts-based advisory firm that specializes in tracking investment fund flows, told FNL , \u201cThere does seem to be a rough correlation between Trump's popularity and fund flows. When Trump was losing ground, we saw some money coming back to Mexican equity funds.\u201d\n\u201cMexican equity funds began to rebound as Trump's poll numbers got worse,\u201d he added. \u201cIn the last two weeks \u2026 it has gone back to outflows.\u201d\nBankers say another way to look at the surge in Mexico\u2019s currency is that Clinton did better on the debate stage than initially expected and that may have buoyed the strength of the peso.\n\u201cIt may be that Clinton did a little bit better than was the initial expectation or you could say that Trump didn\u2019t surprise in any way. Maybe the market was afraid that he was going to have something up his sleeve to surprise and make him look good,\u201d Jesper Bargmann, head of trading for Nordea Bank in Singapore, told Reuters .\nThere are other factors besides Trump\u2019s candidacy that play a part in the up-and-down nature of Mexico\u2019s currency and market analysts warn against predicting the outcome of the U.S. election based on the peso.\nThis year, Mexico has seen declines in foreign loans to the country\u2019s private sector, a drop in oil and mining production, as well a dip as automobile exports to the U.S., an unfortunate confluence of trends that has put downward pressure on Mexican GDP growth and also exacerbated the decline in the peso\u2019s value.\n\u201cIt would not be wise to suggest that is an indicator of election probabilities,\u201d said Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS Wealth Management. \u201cThe typical demographic of the foreign-exchange dealing community may not coincide with the typical demographic of a prospective voter.\u201d\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Hows that refugee importation issue Hillary?....Consider this...

We seemed like every other American,\u201d Salamanca told Fox News Latino. \nIt wasn\u2019t until Salamanca was a senior in high school and started looking into college scholarship money that she realized she couldn\u2019t apply for financial assistance because she didn\u2019t have a social security number. \nFast-forward to 2016. Salamanca, 26, has not only helped ease the burden of many undocumented students hoping to go to college, but she\u2019s proud to say she regularly emails with non-other than Mark Zuckerberg. \nIt all started when she decided to enter a competition called the Voto Latino Innovators Challenge in 2014. The prize was $100K and, if she won, she\u2019d be able to try out her idea to help kids who were brought to the U.S. illegally \u2013 the so-called Dreamers \u2013 go to college. \n\u201cIf I could help just one person not experience what I went through, that\u2019s a success,\u201d Salamanca said. \nAfter a tough competition that included several Ivy-Leaguers, Salamanca won the top prize for her DREAMer\u2019s Roadmap app , which she created with undocumented high school seniors in mind. \nIt provides an extensive up-to-date list of organizations offering scholarships of as little as $100 and as much as $10,000. Additionally, it has an interactive map listing all the U.S. states that offer in-state tuition and/or financial assistance to undocumented students. \nSalamanca, an A-student at the head of her class, said she set up the app to help people with her similar background because when she was looking for financial help to go to college it was nearly impossible to find. \nShe said when she finally gathered the courage to come clean with her teachers and administrators about her citizenship status and ask them for help in her quest, they were of no help. \nThey just didn\u2019t know where to direct her, she said. \nSalamanca was able to attend a local community college with money from a non-profit she found through someone at her church, but had to leave after a year when her father became ill. \nBy 2013 she had become a prolific blogger with \u201cSarahiTV,\u201d where she first explored guiding undocumented students through the process of finding funding. \nAdmittedly not a coder, that year she was happily surprised when she was chosen as one of 20 Dreamers for Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s first \u201cHackathon ,\" a yearly event that brings together undocumented tech innovators to discuss immigration reform. \n\u201cMy story was stronger than my coding,\u201d Salamanca said. \nShe has stayed in contact with Zuckerberg since then, and considers him a mentor. \nIt was the next year, in 2014, when Salamanca decided to go mobile and entered Voto Latino Innovators Challenge with her winning app. \n\u201cLike me, these kids are on their phones all the time, especially if they\u2019re using public transportation. I took the bus to work and it could take me about an hour, so now they could use the time to do something productive,\u201d Salamanca explained. \nShe started in a group of 50 competitors in the Voto Latino challenge. The group whittled down to nine and eventually made it to Washington D.C. for the final competition. \n\"I asked God to help me to be able to communicate my project to the judges. I felt confident despite competing with people from Harvard or Stanford,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I wasn\u2019t capable or worthy enough to be there,\" she said. \nIn the five months since April\u2019s launch, Salamanca\u2019s app has been downloaded 5,000 times -- her goal had been 10,000 in a year. \nHeadquartered in the center of Silicon Valley, in 2015 she received a House of Representatives Award and recently she was included in the list Forbes 30 under 30 . \nSalamanca and her team are now looking to the future. \nShe is considering offering the DREAMer\u2019s Roadmap to all students looking for scholarship money, not just the immigrant community, and perhaps adding legal and health care resources. \nRebekah Sager is a writer/editor for Fox News Latino.

Today, her lead is down to about 7 points. Polls of a four-way-race with minor-party candidates show a similar 3-point contraction in Clinton\u2019s lead.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that that 7 points is a big, big deficit \u2013 the same size as the final result in 2008\u2019s beatdown \u2013 any politician would rather be going up than going down. With more than two months to go, trends still matter more than the actual topline numbers themselves.\n\nIf you want the best snapshot of the state of the race today, look no further than the brand-spanking-new Fox News poll . Treat yourself to some delightful cross-tab action and be amazed.\n\nBut the shorthand is this: Clinton is still ahead, but people still don\u2019t like her and her post-convention post-Trump stumbles bounce has disappeared. The race has returned to the range where it has been mostly since Trump clinched his party\u2019s nomination in May.\n\nA week ago, Clinton\u2019s strategy to keep the focus on Trump and stay out of the spotlight herself was being roundly praised as wise. Now, the alarm bells are ringing: Trump is closing the gap!\n\nBut it\u2019s not the polling that ought to worry Clinton it\u2019s the possibility that she has made a bad bet in her strategy to make the election about Trump.

Trump took advantage of the massively low expectations for his decorum and won the day. His speech at night was all red meat for his base and may have undercut the outreach to skeptical suburbanites, but he definitely came out ahead on the day.\n\nClinton was out giving a speech to the American Legion but mostly ceded the day to Trump, allowing all eyes to turn to his high-wire act. Her bet did not pay off.\n\nWhen the news is about Clinton, it\u2019s always bad news. A leak, a court order, a report, etc. followed by denial and equivocations.

Now, about those white college graduates and Trump: There will be millions and millions of white, college-educated voters pulling the lever for Trump. You and your friends are far from alone. The issue is whether there will be enough of you for him to win. There will be white evangelical Christians without college degrees in deep red states who vote for Clinton. There will be black urban Democrats who vote for Trump. In our crazy, colorful quilt of a country, there\u2019s a little of everything.

[Royal Canadian Mounted Police] spokesman Cpl. Don Wrigglesworth said officers were called to a local gas station shortly before 2 a.m. on Aug. 24 to find the victim completely naked. \u2018He was in excruciating pain and vigorously using his shirt to scrub his genitals with homogenized milk in an attempt to relieve the pain,\u2019 said Wrigglesworth. The man told police he had been attacked by three unknown men, but Wrigglesworth said an investigation revealed the spray pattern \u2018was consistent with the alleged victim carrying his own can of bear spray and it went off unintentionally.\u2019 He said the victim then became uncooperative. Later that night, police were called to a home and found five people outside rolling on the ground after they, too, were hit with bear spray. Wrigglesworth said the five were also uncooperative, but told police they were attacked over a debt.\u201d\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES...\n\u201cHe took a risk, and he pulled it off.

An Uruguayan official said on Sept. 14 that the health of the resettled former Guantanamo detainee has taken a turn for the worse due to a hunger strike he launched to demand relocation to another country. He says he no longer wants to remain in Uruguay and would like to join his wife and daughters in Turkey. Uruguayan officials say they are trying to find another country to accept him. (AP Photo/Matilde Campodonico, File) 2011 AP \nMONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) \u2013   A former Guantanamo prisoner on a hunger strike slipped into a coma Wednesday, said a doctor in Uruguay, where the ex-detainee was taken in as a refugee nearly two years ago but has been demanding to move elsewhere to reunite with his family.\nAbu Wa'el Dhiab was unconscious and extremely dehydrated when paramedics arrived at the apartment where he is staying in Montevideo, said Dr. Julia Galzerano of the Medical Union of Uruguay, who was treating the former prisoner from Syria.\n\"We hope that it is reversible. We can't know\" for a while, Galzerano said. The doctor said she was told Dhiab had gone 12 days without water.\nDhiab was being treated at an apartment in keeping with his wishes not to be hospitalized during his protest.\nHe drew international attention by hunger-striking during his 12 years of occasionally confrontational confinement at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He was released from Guantanamo in December 2014 but could not return to his homeland and was allowed to resettle in Uruguay.\nDhiab has grown increasingly disgruntled in the South American country and launched the hunger strike to pressure the government to allow him to join his family in Turkey or to go to another country.\nChristian Mirza, the former prisoner's liaison with the Uruguayan government, said officials have been working \"at the highest levels\" to find another country to accept him.\nThe 45-year-old Syrian was one of six freed Guantanamo prisoners taken in by Uruguay as a humanitarian gesture by then President Jose Mujica. While the others settled in, Dhiab has struggled. He announced in a Sept. 6 video that he had been on hunger strike at that point for 23 days and that he had taken nothing but water over the preceding five days. His weight was not publicly known.\nAt Guantanamo, where he was detained as an enemy combatant with suspected ties to militants but never charged, his weight dropped at one point to about 155 pounds (70) kilograms, gaunt for a man over 6 feet tall (183 centimeters). Authorities there said he often struggled with guards, who forcibly removed him from his cell at least 48 times in less than a single year of his protest. Troops also said he assaulted them with feces and vomit several times.\nIn Uruguay, Dhiab has stayed out of the public eye recently, protected by activists from several generally anti-government groups who have taken up his cause.\nJon Eisenberg, a California lawyer who represented Dhiab in the past, said he had not spoken with him since Aug. 31 and was unable to get direct information.\n\"I have no doubt that he is quite ill and in despair, but I fear that the people now surrounding him are exploiting his personal despair in pursuit of their own political agenda and are not acting in his best interest,\" Eisenberg said.\nIt was the latest turn in the case of a man who has become an international headache for Uruguay's government.\nLess than two months after his arrival in Uruguay, Dhiab turned up in neighboring Argentina, in violation of an agreement not to travel, and denounced the U.S. failure to close Guantanamo. He appeared in a mock orange prison jumpsuit, an icon of the prison that was opened in 2002 to hold suspected enemy combatants in the war against al-Qaida and the Taliban following the 9/11 terrorist attack.\nDhiab then began publicly complaining about life in Uruguay, to the increasing irritation of the government, and protesting outside the U.S. Embassy, angering members of Congress. In July, he set off alarms when he vanished for several weeks, then turned up in Venezuela, which rejected his request to be sent to Turkey to join his wife and children and sent him back to Uruguay.\nAmbassador Lee Wolosky, the U.S. special envoy for Guantanamo closure, expressed bewilderment Wednesday about Dhiab's situation, saying Uruguay's government had been in \"very advanced stages\" of bringing his wife and children from Turkey when he took off to Venezuela.\n\"I think that Dhiab has been offered every opportunity by the government of Uruguay to move on with his life and he has disgracefully repudiated the extraordinary hospitality and generosity of the government of Uruguay,\" Wolosky said in an interview with The Associated Press.\nThe envoy pointed out the former prisoner had agreed to the resettlement offer and said Uruguay provided him with a $500 monthly stipend and an apartment and offered language and vocational classes. The resettlement of the other five has been a \"success,\" in contrast with Dhiab, he said.\n\"He has gotten more support than refugees receive in that country in the normal course by far and he has received more support than many Uruguayan citizens receive,\" Wolosky said. \"He's had every opportunity to make good choices and be reunited with his family and he has instead made bad choices.\"\n ", "Something no one wants to talk about.

But the opportunities are greater still for legal immigrants who become citizens.\nCitizenship alone can boost individual earnings by 8 to 11 percent, benefiting families, communities and the nation as a whole. Naturalization in greater numbers can even grow our national economy by $21 billion to $45 billion over 10 years, depending on how aggressively we promote it. - New Americans Campaign\nNearly 9 million citizenship-eligible lawful permanent residents (LPR) live in the U.S. today. Yet fewer than 10 percent naturalize each year.\nWe should ask why more LPRs are not taking the critical next step toward citizenship. For many, the reason is cost.\nTo apply for naturalization as an individual costs $680, not including the cost of legal representation. This price has increased by more than 500 percent in just 20 years. And next month, on the heels of Constitution Day and Citizenship Day , that amount is likely to rise again to $725, part of an agency-wide average fee increase of 21 percent at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that the administration has proposed.\nThis proposed fee increase has implications that extend beyond just the naturalization application. Costs associated with other immigration forms also could increase significantly.\nThe application for certificate of citizenship could rise from $600 to $1,170, a 95 percent increase. And appeals for a denied naturalization application are set to increase from $650 to $700, making it more expensive for applicants to challenge erroneous denials.\nAll of these increases will serve to deter some eligible permanent residents and their children from applying for U.S. citizenship.\nBut there\u2019s some good news.\nUSCIS also proposed plans to expand the current fee waiver program for lower-income applicants. The agency\u2019s proposal, a partial fee waiver for citizenship-eligible LPRs who earn between 150 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level, would put citizenship in closer reach for more aspiring Americans.\nFor a family of four, 150 percent of the federal poverty level is income of only $36,450 per year. The administration estimates that more than a million people would become eligible for this 50 percent discount on the citizenship application.\nThat\u2019s a big step in the right direction, and it\u2019s something for which we\u2019ve advocated through the New Americans Campaign.\nBut it doesn\u2019t go far enough. The partial fee waiver affects only 12 percent of all citizenship-eligible LPRs. If this fee waiver were expanded to include those who earn up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level, almost 1 million more LPRs could benefit.\nIt serves our national interest if the privilege of U.S. citizenship is within everyone\u2019s reach. To encourage citizenship is to encourage a stronger American economy.\nCitizenship alone can boost individual earnings by 8 to 11 percent , benefiting families, communities and the nation as a whole. Naturalization in greater numbers can even grow our national economy by $21 billion to $45 billion over 10 years, depending on how aggressively we promote it.\nIn 1787, the U.S. Constitutional Convention produced the document our nation looks to as a beacon for guidance on the toughest issues we face. Constitution Day and Citizenship Day gives us an opportunity to recognize and celebrate all who have become, or aspire to become, citizens of the United States.\nLet\u2019s do more to put citizenship within reach of everyone.\nEric Cohen is the executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which leads the New Americans Campaign, a nationwide network that promotes immigrant integration through citizenship.  \nJosh Hoyt is the executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA).

Most of the fees are attributed to Arpaio's contempt-of-court violations for ignoring a court order to stop his immigration patrols.\nPaul Penzone, the sheriff's Democratic challenger, rejected claims by Arpaio's office that the lawyers who filed the case were responsible for the costs.\n\"There is no room for them to try to portray themselves as victims when they created a problem that we are paying for,\" Penzone said.\nArpaio campaign manager Chad Willems issued a statement saying the American Civil Liberties Union refused to settle the contempt case and instead drove up the taxpayer tab by letting the contempt hearings drag on.\n\"If Penzone wants to side with the ACLU on this issue, he can be our guest,\" Willems said.\nFederal law lets the winners of civil rights cases seek reimbursement for legal costs. County officials bemoaned having to pay the fees, but they said the law required them to do so.\nThe racial profiling lawsuit that Arpaio lost more than three years ago marks the worst legal defeat in his 23 years as sheriff. It morphed into a contempt case after U.S. District Judge Murray Snow accused Arpaio of violating court orders.\nIt also revealed flaws in the agency's internal investigations, which the judge said had been manipulated to shield sheriff's officials from accountability.\nArpaio and Jerry Sheridan, the sheriff's second in command, have been found in civil contempt, and federal prosecutors are considering whether to bring a criminal contempt case that could expose them to jail time.\nThe 84-year-old lawman is seeking his seventh term in office in November.\nSo far, the county has been on the hook for $48.2 million in the profiling case. Estimates on the costs of the case skyrocketed this summer after the judge imposed expensive punishments in response to his civil contempt finding against Arpaio.\nThe future costs include $9.8 million for a court-ordered overhaul of the sheriff's internal affairs operations. Another new cost was $1 million for setting up a county-funded system for compensating Latinos who were illegally detained when Arpaio ignored the immigration patrol order.\nThe sheriff's office was forced to make $8 million in cuts from its budget after the judge ordered the punishments.\nThe agency considered but ultimately rejected a suggestion to shut down \"Tent City,\" a complex of canvas jail tents that helped make Arpaio a national political figure and that the sheriff touted in a recent campaign ad.\nInstead, other cuts were made, including the elimination of a $2.4 million pilot project that would have given a one-time pay increase to some jail officers in a bid to discourage them from seeking jobs elsewhere.\n\"I would definitely choose the detention officers over the tents,\" Penzone said.\nAccording to Sheridan, closing Tent City wouldn't have been as easy as critics claimed, nor would it have produced the savings that the sheriff's detractors were expecting.\n\"It's been spun and misrepresented as the sheriff choosing his tents over his employees, and that's not accurate,\" Sheridan said.\nCecillia Wang, an ACLU attorney who helped press the profiling case against Arpaio, said the rising costs can be traced directly back to the sheriff's contempt violations, which included withholding records at the 2012 profiling trial.\n\"If he hadn't violated court orders, and if he hadn't fought tooth and nail and evaded his legal obligations to turn over documents during the contempt hearing and before the original trial, we never would have had to go to this expense \u2014 on either side,\" Wang said.\nThe vote Wednesday marked the second time that Arpaio's legal foes in the case have sought fees. Two years ago, the attorneys were awarded nearly $4.5 million for the costs of bringing the case to trial.\nArpaio, who earns $100,000 annually as sheriff and owns commercial real estate worth more than $2 million, hasn't had to pay for legal bills directly tied to his official duties in any lawsuits filed against him in his six terms as sheriff.\nIn a bid to get his contempt hearings called off, Arpaio acknowledged the civil violations, offered to make a public apology and proposed a $100,000 donation from his own pocket to a Latino civil rights group.\nSnow had said the donation was an adequate penalty, but he rejected Arpaio's requests to cancel the hearings because the proposal didn't comprehensively resolve the case.\n ", "The pattern with these Islamic terrorist attacks is they come to the USA and return several times to their homeland or some other Islamic country where the FBI & the CIA know that there are ISIS training camps.

Joe Heck with a slight lead over Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, a former Nevada attorney general whom Reid endorsed.\nRepublicans are pouring money into the race, seeing it as their best hope to gain a seat in the Senate.\nCortez Masto\u2019s campaign and supporters are seizing on Heck\u2019s backing of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and casting him as a local version of the real estate mogul.\nRecently her campaign announced a grassroots coalition, \u201cLatinos for Cortez Masto,\u201d that includes more than 200 supporters. \nIn a statement, Cortez Masto pointed out that she's a granddaughter of a Mexican immigrant who achieved the American Dream. The United States, she stated, has provided her \u201cthe opportunity to be elected as the first Latina U.S. senator in U.S. history.\u201d\nThe statement portrays her opponent as dangerous to Latinos and immigrants.\n\u201cThe message that Donald Trump is sending is getting [Latinos] energized,\u201d Cortez Masto told Fox News Latino. \u201cHe called Mexicans rapists and criminals. It energizes people to come out and vote against Donald Trump.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cCongressman Heck has not said one thing to take on Donald Trump about this message of hate.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting for Latinos in this state,\u201d Cortez Masto said. \u201cEvery single one of them is hard-working, working two jobs, and then going home to take care of their siblings.\u201d\nHer mentor, Harry Reid, also recently mentioned Heck and Trump in the same breath.\n\u201cTrump is going to lose Nevada, and Joe Heck deservedly is going to lose the Senate race,\u201d Reid told reporters recently.\nIn 2010, Reid's Senate opponent, Sharron Angle, made immigration a cornerstone of her campaign and famously described the Senate Minority Leader as \u201cthe best friend an illegal alien ever had.\u201d\nWhile Trump has consistently employed hardline immigration rhetoric like Angle did, Heck is more centrist on the issue.\nAsked about his support for Trump, Heck told Fox News Latino that he had pledged to back the party\u2019s nominee for president, whoever that turned out to be.\n\u201cMy view is that I\u2019m concentrating on the Senate race, while the other side is trying to link me and Donald Trump.\u201d\nThe three-term U.S. representative told FNL that he supports comprehensive immigration reform, but not in one sweeping bill. He\u2019d rather see the issue addressed in piecemeal fashion.\n\u201cThe other side tries to twist the narrative,\u201d Heck said. \u201cThings get shoved into a [comprehensive] bill that have nothing to do with immigration. We need to do it in an accountable and transparent way.\u201d\nHeck supports giving undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children \u2013 so-called \"Dreamers\" \u2013 a path to legal status. But like many Republican elected officials, he does not support President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions giving Dreamers a reprieve from deportation and the ability to obtain work permits and some government benefits.\n\u201cThey\u2019re kids that were brought here through no fault of their own \u2013 they need a path to citizenship,\u201d Heck said, adding that he had worked on a bill several years ago that would have given them a chance to legalize, but then lost the support of Dreamers at the last minute.\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Heck said, adding that they told him they did not support the draft measure because it didn\u2019t include relief for their parents. Heck said parents had never been part of the discussions his staff had with the young immigrants while working on the bill.\n\u201cIt happened for political reasons,\u201d he said.\nWhile Heck holds a slight edge, Cortez Masto leads him among Latino voters, 58-to-24 percent \u2013 a considerable advantage, but smaller than Hillary Clinton\u2019s edge over Trump among Latinos.\nMany Latino voters, expected to be about 20 percent of the state's electorate this year, have said in polls that they are not very familiar with either Heck or Cortez Masto.\nFernando Romero \u2013 head of Hispanics in Politics, the oldest Hispanic political group in Las Vegas \u2013 says that given Cortez Masto's statewide role as attorney general, she should be polling better than she is.\nDespite the strong Democratic machine that Reid offers, the national Democratic Party has not put enough resources into bolstering Cortez Masto, Romero said.\n\u201cI think it will have an adverse effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not giving her the support she needs.\u201d\nThe two candidates are portraying themselves as people in touch with the state\u2019s various communities who understand the struggles and hopes of all Nevadans.\nCortez Masto, the daughter of a Mexican-American father and an Italian-American mother, said she empathizes with immigrant families struggling to improve their lot in life and give their kids a better future.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father made it very clear to my sister and me that education is key, and you\u2019re going to get one.\u201d\nHeck told FNL that Hispanics who know him and his positions know he isn't the demagogues that Democrats are portraying him as.\n\u201cWe spend a great deal of time in the different communities,\u201d Heck said. \u201cYou have to be visible and engaged in those communities all year long. I have Spanish-speakers working in my congressional office. I meet with the consul general of Mexico regularly.\u201d\nPolitical experts say a strong turnout by white working-class voters energized by Trump would help Heck. A strong turnout by minorities, on the flip side, would boost Cortez Masto.\n\u201cIt remains to be seen if Hillary Clinton is going to drive voters to the polls the way Barack Obama did,\u201d said Brian Baluta, a Heck campaign spokesman, according to Roll Call . \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fought tooth-and-nail, because this is the race that is going to decide the Senate.\u201d\nBut Cortez Masto supporters are hoping that convincing voters, particularly minorities, that Heck is a mirror image of Trump can tilt the election in the former attorney general\u2019s favor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely close at all levels of the ticket,\u201d Yvanna Cancela, political director for the Culinary Union, told Roll Call. \u201cThe level of anger toward Trump and his policy proposals and rhetoric is real. And I think the more Joe Heck is revealed to be aligned with Donald Trump, the better it is for Catherine.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Llorente is the Politics Editor/Senior Reporter for Fox News Latino, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnewslatino.com.

It did not break them down according to country of origin, but recent trends suggest the majority are likely from Haiti.\nThat would mark a huge increase over the number seen so far this year. The institute said a total of 7,800 Haitian migrants entered Mexico through Guatemala between Jan. 1 and Sept. 21, as well as 1,701 migrants from Africa and 3,753 from various Asian.\nThe institute said that none of these Haitian, African or Asian migrants have requested permission to stay in Mexico. \"Up to this moment, the institute has not received any requests from these foreigners for refuge, asylum or regularization, because they have expressed that their desire is to reach the United States.\"\nThe migrants cannot be sent back to their home countries, so Mexico gives them 20-day temporary visas so they can cross the country and get to the U.S. It said the Africans came mainly from the Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Nigeria.\nHowever, this week the U.S. government said it was widening efforts to deport Haitians in response to the wave of thousands of immigrants from the Caribbean nation who have overwhelmed California border crossings with Mexico in recent months.\nMexico said that in Baja California alone, about 1,230 Haitian, African and Asian migrants are waiting for asylum in the United States, in many cases at border crossing gates or bridges.\nThe institute said Mexico was trying to provide the asylum seekers with food and water while they waited for a U.S. response.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana testified in Congress that other governments told her on a recent trip to Central America that 40,000 Haitians were on their way and called it an \"emergency situation\" on California's border.\nA government move lifted special protections that shielded Haitians from deportation after their nation's 2010 earthquake.\nThe change may dramatically affect Haitians who have been showing up at U.S. border crossings in California, claiming they lived in Brazil for several years, left for economic reasons, and traveled through Central America and Mexico. Homeland Security officials say about 5,000 Haitians have been stopped at San Diego's San Ysidro port of entry since October, compared to only 339 for the 2015 fiscal year. Large numbers have also turned themselves in to U.S. inspectors in Calexico, California, 120 miles east of San Diego.\nThe influx is so heavy that inspectors at San Ysidro, the nation's busiest border crossing, are turning back Haitians with appointments to come at a later date, leaving hundreds waiting in Tijuana, Mexico. Many stay at one of the Mexican border city's five migrant shelters that volunteered in May to help.\nThe Rev. Pat Murphy, director of Casa del Migrante in Tijuana, said 90 percent of the people who have come to his shelter in the last six weeks are Haitians who moved to Brazil after the 2010 earthquake.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "Nobody wants to talk about Fat Miss Universe contestants or Bill Clintons ladies... .We dont care. \nAmericans are paying too much for Healthcare. \nAmericans are paying for illegal immigration. \nAmericans are being murdered in American Cities and everyone stays silent. \nTerrorists are shooting up malls.... \nSome cities need the military not the police.", "  Rep. Pete Gallego in a Sept. 25, 2012, file photo. ap \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2013   A West Texas congressional district sprawls 58,000-plus square miles and two time zones, from San Antonio to just outside El Paso. Yet neither the Republican who represents it nor the Democrat trying to reclaim the seat actually lives there.\nThe home of first-term Republican Rep. Will Hurd, 39, is in the San Antonio suburb of Helotes, just outside the borders of a district that is larger in land area than 29 states.\nThe challenger, former Rep. Pete Gallego, spends most of his time away from the district in Austin, but lists his official address as the remote town of Alpine, which is in the district. One of the properties his family owns there \u2014 a boarded up home and former cafe site \u2014 was recently slapped with a sign declaring it a \"dangerous\" violation of Alpine safety codes. Gallego has declined to say if he ever stays at one of the others.\nGallego, 54, keeps a district apartment in San Antonio that serves as his base while campaigning, but his wife, Maria Elena Ramon, and 11-year-old son Nicolas live 80 miles north of San Antonio in Austin. Contracts show Gallego worked in governmental relations positions there as recently as the summer of 2015, but a statement his campaign released Wednesday said he \"is not and never has been a registered lobbyist.\"\nFederal candidates aren't required to live in the district where they run for office, and districts represented by members of Congress who reside elsewhere are fairly common throughout the country. But few districts nationwide are as large as the one Hurd and Gallego are contesting.\nConservative Texas activists have sometimes tried to make living outside a congressional district an issue. GOP primary challenger and Dallas-area tea party organizer Katrina Pierson, now a national spokeswoman for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, accused longtime Republican Rep. Pete Sessions of it in 2014. That charge didn't stick and Sessions trounced Pierson. Hurd faced no serious primary challenger this cycle.\n\"You can't really make the argument that Will doesn't live in the district, either. He's in San Antonio all the time when he's away from Washington,\" said Hurd campaign manager Justin Hollis.\nA former Texas A&M student body president, Hurd spent nine years with the CIA in India, New York, Afghanistan and Pakistan before returning to Texas. Hurd's house in Helotes was part of the district when he first ran for Congress and lost in the Republican primary in 2010, Hollis said, and now is \"less than 100 yards\" outside it according to more-recent redistricting maps.\nAsked why Hurd hasn't moved into the district since, Hollis said it was a moot point because the congressman \"lives a stone's throw away.\"\nThe race is the only competitive one among Texas' 36 congressional districts. Hurd unseated Gallego two years ago by 2,422 votes out of more than 115,000 cast. Gallego is hoping that Trump's harsh immigration rhetoric and promises to build a wall the length of the U.S.-Mexico border can boost him in a district that's nearly 70 percent Hispanic and features 800-plus miles of Texas-Mexico border. Hurd counters that voters care more about issues like national security than about having Trump's name topping the GOP ticket.\nGallego says his family's Austin home is an investment property that his wife owns separately. Prior to his first congressional run in 2012, Gallego spent 22 years in the Texas Legislature. Although it meets in Austin, he kept a residence in Alpine because of a mandate in the state constitution that legislators live in the districts they represent.\n\"Alpine has been and always will be home,\" Gallego said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"Like many West Texans, my jobs have required me to travel. And, like many families, we've balanced two careers with raising a family.\"\nAlpine is a picturesque town 375 miles west of San Antonio where the cowboy culture and high desert mountain-dotted vistas seem straight out of a Hollywood western. Gallego was born and raised there and county records show he and his parents own several local properties, but Gallego avoided questions about where he resides while in town.\nBoth candidates' out-of-district residency may not mean much in a part of Texas that takes pride in just how empty it is. Featuring expansive pastureland, the district is listed by the U.S. Census Bureau as 99.5 percent rural, even though it includes swaths of San Antonio.\n\"The remoteness is the charm,\" said Tonya Tiday, assistant director of the Alpine Chamber of Commerce. She said Gallego's family name has long resonated in close-knit Alpine, but how much time he actually spends in town isn't a major concern.\n\"The sense of community is different than other places,\" Tiday said. \"It's the reason you'll never see a Wal-Mart out here.\"\n ", "  Juan Navarro Rios on a jail booking photo provided by the Dallas County Sheriff's Department. ap \nA man who allegedly killed two people in separate incidents around the Dallas-area over the weekend was living in the United States illegally and had previously been deported three times to Mexico, immigration officials said on Wednesday.\nDallas County jail officials discovered the suspect initially identified as Silvestre Franco-Luviano was using an alias. The 40-year-old suspect's true identity is Juan Navarro Rios, said Dallas County sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda Urbina.\nThe false identity was discovered as Navarro Rios was being booked into the Dallas County jail after his transfer from the Williamson County Jail in Georgetown. He is suspected of killing a motorist in Dallas and a man at a gas station in nearby Cedar Hill. Police have not released a motive for either slaying, both of which occurred on Sunday night.\nCriminal records had identified Navarro Rios over the years by some variation of Silvestre Franco-Luviano. He was initially deported in June 1996 for a felony conviction, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Carl Rusnok said Wednesday. ICE declined to say what the felony conviction was, but court records show the Mexican national had a 1995 assault conviction in Dallas and a 1996 conviction for hindering prosecution. Those records don't provide details of the allegations.\nNavarro Rios returned to the U.S. at some point and was again deported in October 2009 for re-entering by falsely claiming U.S. citizenship, Rusnok said. He again came back into the U.S. and was prosecuted on vehicle burglary charges in the Texas city of Georgetown in 2010 and 2011. He was deported in March 2014 after completing a prison sentence for re-entry after deportation, according to a statement Wednesday from ICE.\nHe was arrested Tuesday after a standoff at his relatives' apartment in Georgetown, about 25 miles north of Austin, according to police. He was transferred Wednesday from the Williamson County jail to the Dallas County jail after his arrest on a murder warrant in the death of Ruben Moreno, who was in his car when he was shot. He's also a suspect in the death of Welton Betts. Georgetown police also have charged him with vehicle burglary.\nJail records do not list an attorney for Navarro Rios who could comment on the allegations. ICE placed an immigration detainer on him immediately after his arrest, meaning the agency is asking that he not be released.\nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \n "], "NBCNews.com": ["Oct 6 2016, 8:33 am ET Hawaii's Kokua Kalihi Valley Health Nonprofit Is Turning New Citizens into New Voters by Chris Fuchs The oath of citizenship is administered at a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services swearing-in ceremony in Honolulu, Hawaii, on June 7, 2016. Courtesy of KKV Share advertisement \nIn the 2012 general election, Hawaii had the lowest percentage of registered voters and the lowest voter turnout in all 50 states, according to the U.S. Census and the United States Election Project . Those numbers have led one organization on the island of Oahu to visit local festivals and citizenship swearings-in, in an effort to bring more Hawaiians to the polls come November. \nKokua Kalihi Valley Comprehensive Family Services (KKV), a community health nonprofit in Honolulu founded in the 1970s, began its voter registration push last March, with staff first talking about how they and their communities feel about voting, Ashley Galacgac, program coordinator of community education and civic engagement, told NBC News. KKV is a member of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), which has done similar work with its \"My Health, My Vote\" initiative. \"The first act as an American citizen is voting or registering to vote, which I think is significant considering many Americans who are born here don't even vote as a first act.\" \nHawaii's deadline to register to vote in the general election is Oct. 10, according to the state Office of Elections website. \n\"The first act as an American citizen is voting or registering to vote, which I think is significant considering many Americans who are born here don't even vote as a first act,\" Jeffrey Tangonan Acido, KKV program manager of community education and civic engagement, told NBC News. \nRELATED: Health Organizations Focus on Voter Push with 'My Health, My Vote' \nLooking to register new voters, KKV both last and this summer attended the Crop Shop Food Festival in Kalihi, a program to connect farmers and their local products to the community, Galacgac and Acido said. But complicating the group's efforts, Acido said, is the fact that 30 to 40 percent of residents living in Kalihi, a Honolulu neighborhood, are ineligible to vote. \nAcido said that's because Kalihi has a large population from the Federated States of Micronesia, American Samoa, and the Philippines. The Compact of Free Association , signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1986, allows Micronesian residents to live, work, and study in the U.S. without visas. Many, in turn, migrate to nearby Hawaii and, according to Acido, live in Kalihi's public housing. \nAmerican Samoans can vote in presidential primaries, though not in the general election. Filipinos, who Acido said make up at least 25 percent of Kalihi's population, are often not citizens or are undocumented and thus cannot cast ballots. Post by NBC News . \nKKV, Acido said, has had better success registering voters after citizenship ceremonies in Honolulu, the capital of Oahu. Those are often held twice a month, with as many as 50 to 100 people taking the oath, he said. At those events, KKV can sometimes get up to 60 percent of new citizens to fill out voter paperwork, according to Acido. \nBut the rub, community activists say, is translating voter registrations into voter turnout, both of which in Hawaii have been among the country's lowest. \nThe U.S. Census reported that in 2012, 54.1 percent of Hawaii's then 1,013,000 residents were registered to vote. On Election Day that year, just 44.5 percent of Hawaiians cast ballots, according to the United States Election Project, placing the state last in getting voters to the polls. ( West Virginia was about tied with Hawaii for that distinction.) \"I think that's the reflection of the low voter turnout that we're experiencing, that's really complicated in Hawaii, [and] that many people don't understand, including ourselves.\" \nAcido, a Filipino immigrant and naturalized U.S. citizen, said he believes many Native Hawaiians prefer to be left alone and not engage with the government. \n\"I think that's the reflection of the low voter turnout that we're experiencing, that's really complicated in Hawaii, [and] that many people don't understand, including ourselves,\" he said. \nThe physical distance between Hawaii and Washington, D.C., Acido added, also serves to sharpen the political disconnect. \nIt's unclear how this year's presidential race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton will affect registration and voter turnout rates in Hawaii. Pew Research reported in June that nationwide participation this primary season was high, with 28.5 percent of estimated eligible voters casting ballots. But it still fell short of record turnout in 2008, when 30.4 percent of voting-age citizens went to the polls for both Republican and Democratic primaries, according to Pew. Jeffrey Tangonan Acido signs up a new citizen to vote after a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services swearing-in ceremony in Honolulu on June 7, 2016. Courtesy of KKV \nAcido said his organization doesn't have the funding to follow up to see whether KKV's voter registration initiative has paid off. While not all Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders might be sold on voting, Acido added that doing so does have benefits. \n\"It gets money towards our community, it gets resources toward our community, it passes policies like marriage equality, it passes policies that improve housing, it raises the minimum wage,\" he said, noting that empowering a community to solve its own problems is also important. \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Four of the last five public polls of the race there showed it to be virtually tied, with Hillary Clinton or Trump leading by just a point. \nBut within that context, his Tuesday visit remains quixotic, since Prescott Valley is in a deep-red county that went nearly 65 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012. And as Trump tends to carry controversy wherever he goes, some Arizona Republicans are wary of his plans. \n\"I dunno if its particularly helpful to anyone here for him to come,\" the Arizona Republican operative said. \n\"Every time he's come [to the state], it kind of sucks up all the energy from everything else going on.

John McCain in a bind by delivering a fiery speech laying out a hard-line immigration policy that effectively called for mass deportation and eliminated any possibility of a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. \nMcCain was a member of the Gang of Eight group of bipartisan senators that tried and failed to push through Congress a more moderate view of immigration reform, one that included a pathway to citizenship. His advocacy on the issue has drawn him considerable blowback from conservatives and, this cycle, the strongest primary challenge of his career. \nMcCain seems likely at this point to win reelection, and easily outrun Trump \u2014 his margin in the polls has expanded even as Trump's has narrowed. \nDealing with the controversy at the top of the ticket, however, hasn't made things easy. \nGrant Woods, a longtime friend of McCain who served as his first chief of staff, said he had spoken to the senator the day after Trump's immigration speech and McCain was less than enthused. \n\"I think its fair to say that he would've preferred that that not happen,\" Woods said when asked if McCain was frustrated with Trump's speech. \nWoods himself was a bit more blunt.

LOUIS, Missouri - In the latest release from the weekly tracking poll sponsored by NALEO (National Association of Latino Elected Officials) and Telemundo and conducted by Latino Decisions, data flowing in continues to paint an increasingly bleak picture for the Trump campaign, while trends continue to improve for Hillary Clinton. Nonetheless, concerns continue over Latino voters' perceptions of Democrat outreach into the Latino community. \nClinton's approval ratings among Latino voters have held steady, at 66 percent, but her share of Latino voters appear to be getting stronger. Four weeks ago, when the tracking poll first started asking voters who they would vote for, 71 percent indicated that Clinton would be their choice on election day. Today that number has inched up, to 74 percent, while Trump's numbers appears to be trending downward, from 18 percent four weeks ago to 16 percent today.

For instance, 42 percent of Latinos say they have been contacted by a political party, campaign, or other political organization, where 39 percent they had been contacted four weeks ago. Of those Latino voters being contacted, 63 percent they were contacted by Democrats, whereas that number was 51 percent four weeks ago. \nThis means that even though the data suggests the Democrats are doing better reaching out to Latinos, Latino voters continue to be unsatisfied by the Party's efforts. The high levels of enthusiasm by Latinos in this election, at 51 percent, suggests Latinos are hungry and willing to be courted this year. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

ETIENNE LAURENT / EPA ", "latest posts from WHAT ARE THE FACTS? 7 hours ago Trump's Assessment of the Race Isn't Accurate \nTo hear Trump tell it, the presidential race is going great: he's winning everything, he'll likely be elected in just two short weeks. But based on the polls and facts at hand, that's just not right. \nHere's what he got right, and wrong, on the state of the race from Tuesday's Florida race. \n\"We're going to have a great victory. We're leading Iowa, we're leading Ohio, we're doing great in north Carolina, Pennsylvania we're going to a lot, I think we're going to do great there.\" \nUnlikely, true, true, false, and unlikely. Trump is polling poorly nationally, and his chances at winning in two weeks are slim. He is leading on average in Iowa and Ohio, but he's trailing by an average of two points in North Carolina and an average of nearly six points in Pennsylvania. \n\"Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track. Every poll says it. We are going to fix it.\" \nThe polls don't say that: on average, 64 percent \u2014 not 75 percent \u2014 of people say the country is on the wrong track. \n\"There's going to be a lot of Brexit in two weeks.\" \nNope, and we already explained why here. 8 hours ago Trump Unloads on 'Scum' Fact Checkers. We Checked That Claim Too \n\"Even the so-called fact checkers, who are crooked as hell themselves, they'll check facts with me, and I'll be like 99 percent right, and they'll say therefore he lied! These people are bad\u2026.What a group of dishonest scum we have, I'm telling you,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \nWhile our moms would surely like to dispute the contention that we're \"scum\" and \"crooked as hell,\" let's focus instead on his claim that fact checkers exaggerate small errors. \nThis blog primarily focuses on large whoppers, and makes it clear when Trump's claims are rooted in fact. As this blog is just six weeks old, let's also take a look at the most comprehensive listing of Trump fact checks catalogued by our friends at PolitiFact. They have found 150 claims with significant inaccuracies earning them a \"false\" or \"pants on fire\" ruling. Just 78 claims earned the \"mostly true\" or \"half true\" rating that Trump might argue were an exaggeration. \nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton actually gets a lot more \"mostly true\" or \"half true\" claims\": half of her claims, 140, are rated as that. (Just 35 are \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") \nBy the numbers, the fact checkers are focusing on Trump's biggest lies -- not exaggerating tiny errors. Trump Rewrites Republican Primary to Make His Win Sound Bigger, Better \nDonald Trump is re-imagining the Republican primary as a bigger battle and a bolder win. \nSpeaking in Florida Monday, he boasted, \"We got the most votes in the history of the primary system,\" by winning \"41 \u2014 sorry, 42 states\" in the lead up to the general election. On Tuesday, he told Fox News he didn't regret anything in his bid for the White House because he'd already beaten \"17 people.\" \n\"We had a total of 17 \u2014 really 18 \u2014 and won,\" he added. \nNone of that is true. Trump won 36 states, not 42. H e only beat 16 challengers on the way to the GOP ticket. And h e won the most votes in the history of Republican primaries, not the primary process overall: He was still millions behind Hillary Clinton's final tally in both 2016 and 2008, not to mention Barack Obama's 2008 tally. \nTrump won the Republican primary, but he didn't win it in the way he said. 12 hours ago No, the Presidential Election Will Not Be the Next 'Brexit' for Pollsters \nMonths after voters in the United Kingdom defied surveys and chose to leave the European Union \u2014 after pollsters had widely predicted the country would remain \u2014 Donald Trump is betting on the American electorate delivering another polling surprise. \n\"Believe me, this is Brexit times five,\" Trump said in Pennsylvania last week. \nBut experts say a polling upset on November 8th is incredibly unlikely, and that the Brexit comparison just doesn't hold water. 15 hours ago Trump Cites Police, Military, ICE Endorsements That Didn't Happen \nOn Monday, Donald Trump told News4Jax that the United States military \"conceptually\" endorsed him and that \"virtually every police department\" in the country backed his bid for the presidency. During last week's third debate, Trump said his hardline stance on immigration and pledge to build a border wall had earned him an endorsement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 2 days ago Trump Claims Media Isn't Asking Kaine About Catholics. They Are \nTrump asked on Twitter why Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine, a practicing Catholic, was not being asked about the hacked WikiLeaks emails that appear to show Clinton campaign staffers mocking Catholicism. \nKaine has been asked about them in nearly every national TV interview he's done in the last week. \nHe was asked about this twice last Sunday ABC's This Week and Fox News Sunday , CNBC two days later , and was pressed on the same issue on NBC News' Meet the Press yesterday. Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win! 2 days ago No, ISIS Isn't Rooting for Clinton \nISIS is \"dreaming that Hillary Clinton becomes President. ISIS, their number one dream, Hillary Clinton, let her become President. She's the one that allowed it to form, she's the one that watched it go, now they say it's in 32 countries, worse than ever.\"A dozen interviews with ISIS extremists and a review of their social media networks by Foreign Affairs magazine found that the terrorist group has a strong preference in the 2016 election: they'd like to see Donald Trump elected, not Clinton. \nFact checkers have also reviewed Trump's repeated claim that ISIS' rise is directly Clinton's fault and declared it to be false . 3 days ago Trump Cites Pew Study as Proof of Fraud, But Study Doesn't Find It \n\"According to the highly respected Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate ... There are 1.8 million dead people that are registered right now to vote. And folks, folks, some of them vote,\" Trump said Saturday night while calling the election \"rigged.\" \nThis 2012 Pew study notes that the voter rolls are wildly out of date and advocates for modernizing the system to save taxpayer money. It finds no proof of voter fraud; the study's only mention of voter fraud is merely that error-riddled voter logs lead to the \"perception\" of being susceptible to fraud. \nIn practice, experts say widespread voter fraud just doesn't exist. Poll observers say that if a voter moves to another state or dies, they don't vote twice and aren't likely to be impersonated. A Loyola researcher who reviewed a billion ballots found 31 credible cases of voter fraud . 4 days ago Yup, the Investor's Business Daily Poll Was the Most Accurate in 2012 \nDonald Trump likes to blur the polls. He's boasted of winning ones that didn't exist, and earlier this week he said he'd won every single post-debate online tally \u2014 not true, since our own NBC News/Survey Monkey showed Hillary Clinton winning and even Breitbart's survey said the same for a time \u2014 so when Trump started talking up the credentials of a lesser-known poll, our fact checker's ear was piqued. \n\"We're leading in three recent polls the last day: Rasmussen, LA Times, Investor's Business Daily. The last one was the most accurate poll of the last cycle, so that's a good sign!\" he said. \nSure enough, Trump's spot on here: Investor's Business Daily was indeed the most accurate poll of 2012 among the more prolific pollsters. He's leading Clinton by just one point in the national poll of 789 likely voters \u2014 within the margin of error to be sure \u2014 but leading nonetheless.

Trump appeared to be particularly focused on the minority vote as he laid out his \" New Deal for Black America .\" \nAmong the highlights of the \"law and order\" candidate's new deal were designating \"blighted communities with \"disaster designations\" as well as holding on to his tried and true call for a wall at the Mexican border because \"Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans,\" adding that tighter reigns on immigration would \"restore civil rights.\" \nIn addition to Trump's new deal the Republican candidate made what many are calling an awkward attempt to reach out to Indian American voters with his latest campaign ad where he attempts to speak a bit of Hindi . \nThe attempt was reminiscent of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's less than graceful attempts to speak Spanish at multiple news conferences.

She will be responsible for how trillions of dollars in federal funding are spent, decide how to ensure both liberty and security in an increasingly interconnected world and determine the path forward on health care and Social Security. I am voting for Hillary Clinton.\" \nWhile McKesson's words are strong Clinton did not come by this endorsement easily. Clinton among other candidates failed to impress McKesson and other Black activists who demanded to hear more about candidates plans to address racial injustice, especially in regard to police brutality.

That said San Francisco 49er's quarterback Colin Kaepernick (as well as the league itself) doesn't believe the league wide protests during the national anthem are to blame. As Kaepernick puts it, \"I don't understand why ratings would go down, fighting for justice for people, to try to stop oppression, especially in a league that is predominantly black.\" \nWhile there is no way to tell for sure even if the protests sparked by Kaepernick has let some air out of the NFL's tires it's likely not the only reason. In addition to the leagues prime-time games running up against election coverage some have sighted lower quality of play, over-saturation (games are now on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday) as well as NFL viewing options like NFL Redzone and Sunday Ticket affecting the league's overall ratings.

Agan Singh with his three-year-old daughter, Satya. For Halloween 2016, Satya told her parents she wanted to be her \"dada.\" Courtesy of Raakhee Mirchandani \nIt's methodical, deliberate, and badass. \nNext to him, our little daughter Satya is perched on a stool. She's too tiny to reach the sink by herself, but she's determined to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her father, inspecting the process. Without saying a word \u2014 he can't talk because he has a strange habit of holding one end of the turban in his mouth while he's putting it on \u2014 they share in a breathtaking ritual, a daily reminder of his Sikh faith, strength, and commitment. \nEveryday when he leaves home, Agan is boldly telling the world who he is and what he stands for. And, even in the face of fear (there have been both verbal and physical assaults) he stands firm in who he is and what he's about. \nBut the turban isn't a statement. It's a command that he respect himself and his family, that he serve the community, and that he treat all people fairly and equally. \nSo it's no surprise that my husband is all sorts of #dadgoals. He's patient, disciplined, and kind. He'll read four books a night (even when he promises \"just two\"), never yells when she's squashing what seems like our last nerve, and rarely complains when she wakes up early \u2014 unreasonable toddler demands in full effect that often involve oatmeal, a rubber glove, and her doctor's kit. (It sounds creepier than it is, it's actually pretty cute.) \nI can't help but marvel at the sight of them \u2014 watching their two faces in the mirror every morning, or their heads bent over a crayon canvas in the evening. Satya likes me just fine, but she's obsessed with her \"dada.\" Again Singh and Raakhee Mirchandani with their daughter, Satya. Courtesy of Raakhee Mirchandani \nSo as October approached, we asked Satya about Halloween. Last year we picked her costume (pizza rat) because she was almost two years old and had no preferences. But the last year has brought with it opinions by the millions, intense feelings about everything from the pattern on the toilet paper (she likes dogs) to the amount of flare in her hair (we've done everything from three buns to five ponytails). So when she declared that she was going to be her \"dada\" for Halloween, I knew that was it. Nothing we could say would change her mind, and why would we even want to? \"In a year where the anti-immigrant sentiment seems deeper than ever, it made us proud that this second-generation American toddler seems to know exactly who she is and what she stands for.\" \nLet me break it down for you: Satya is an adorable almost three-year-old girl with more personality than can fit in her tiny little frame. She likes animal print, cat sweatshirts, and unicorn sneakers. Agan is a handsome six-foot-tall Sikh man, complete with a beard, mustache and turban. Everything about him is on the straight and narrow, including his uniform of plaid shirts, jeans, and Converse. How exactly would this work? \nWardrobe was easy enough, but she was determined to wear a turban. The thing is, for the most part, Sikh women don't wear patkas or turbans, certainly not the kind of style you find a three-year-old girl eager to sport. Her choice was peculiar, but it was also passionate, purposeful, and pretty damn amazing. And in a year where the anti-immigrant sentiment seems deeper than ever, it made us proud that this second-generation American toddler seems to know exactly who she is and what she stands for. \nI often struggle with how to share our Indian heritage with Satya. Agan and I are both first-generation American, our parents are immigrants. Our connection to the motherland was direct \u2014 heard in our parents' accents, tasted in our moms' cooking, and felt in the prayers they said for their families in Delhi and Bombay. It was the '80s and landline phone calls were exorbitant, travel was pricey, and money was tight. And they were a long ways from home. I was raised in New Jersey, Agan in California. We're a little Jay Z and a little Jagjit Singh, pizza and paneer. We speak English at home, watch football on Sundays, and are constantly in search of where we'll get our next tan. The truth is, my Sindhi isn't as good as my dad's, my cooking is a poor imitation of my mother's and, well, I worry that the hybrid faith we offer Satya (I'm Hindu, Agan is Sikh) is too free spirited to be meaningful. Agan Singh with his three-year-old daughter, Satya. Courtesy of Raakhee Mirchandani \nSo when Satya put on that turban \u2014 her idea, her choice \u2014 even though it was just for a Halloween party, it gave us faith that something we were doing was clicking, that the values we were living and also trying to share with her were sticking. Most importantly, she's marching to her own beat, not afraid to stand out, and comfortable in her own skin, in a way that I still struggle with. And that's how it goes with toddlers: just when you think you're dropping something deep on them, they turn it around and teach you a lesson. \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Jorge Duenes / REUTERS file Share advertisement \nA sudden recent shift in American deportation policy may have dire implications for thousands of Haitians, and cause a bleak homecoming for many in the wake of destruction brought by Hurricane Matthew. \nThe hurricane was billed as the most powerful storm to touch the Atlantic in nearly a decade as it made landfall in Haiti early Tuesday morning. At least 19 people were confirmed dead by the time the storm passed over the island of Hispaniola. \nAnd thousands more Haitians who are currently in America may soon face fallout from the disaster, all for a new change in United States immigration policies that critics warn is ill-fated and poorly timed.

Cutting back on the humanitarian-driven initiative \u2014 and thereby resuming regular deportations to Haiti \u2014 would come just as the nation begins recovery from the latest crisis. \n\"Haitians don't have a place to go back to,\" said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliances San Diego, an organization that has helped a large number of Haitians arriving in the U.S. \"To shut the door on these people is to put them in a very vulnerable and dire situation that will have tragic consequences.\" \nThe policy shift came out of an extraordinary wave of migrants coming to the U.S. As many as 5,000 Haitians were intercepted at the border within the last year alone, administration officials said last month, up from 339 entries the year before. Most all entered through southern California, overwhelming already stretched resources and raising alarms that many more would follow. \nIn announcing the policy change last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the situation in Haiti had \"improved sufficiently\" since it was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010.

And a cholera epidemic brought by United Nations relief workers has killed at least 10,000 people over that same time period. Meanwhile, political instability has lurched the country into flashpoints of chaos. \nThe damage from Hurricane Matthew has even meant that the highly anticipated elections scheduled for the weekend would instead be postponed for a later date. The delays add pressure to an already fraught dynamic. Just a year ago elections dissolved into riots after residents suspected the results were tainted by fraud. \nImmigration advocates in the U.S. fear those issues, coupled with a bleak economic outlook and widespread food insecurity, could compound into a much larger issue with lasting effects. \n\"Haiti has limited resources, limited employment opportunities and if deported, these people have a limited chance of prospering in such desperate conditions,\" Ginger Jacobs, chair of the San Diego Immigrant Rights Project, said in a statement Tuesday. \nRelated: Haiti's Forlorn History Suggests Matthew Could Be Another Killer \nAccording to Jacobs, U.S. agencies seem at odds with one another in their assessment of the conditions inside Haiti. While the Department of Homeland Security pursues a more regular deportation schedule to Haiti, the U.S. State Department has issued several travel alerts on the books warning to stay away. The alerts point to high pockets of crime and limited access to healthcare and medical supplies. \nAdvocacy groups that work closely with the Haitian American community and its leaders said they were completely blindsided by the policy change. The first notification that many received of Johnson's directive, which would have an immediate impact on the communities they serve, was through phone calls from journalists asking them to respond to the news.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \"It's a positive story on the impact of skills and up-skilling on the American workforce,\" said Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce chief economist, Nicole Smith. The report found that employment growth is most rapid in high-skill jobs and in ones where continued training is imperative, in fields like education, professional services and health care.\nAccording to the survey of more than 5,000 Americans, including nearly 3,100 in the workforce, which was conducted by Pew in conjunction with the Markle Foundation, people are roughly split on whether immigration helps or hurts American workers, at 42 percent and 45 percent, respectively. This is a significant shift from a decade earlier, when only 28 percent said immigrants contribute positively to the American labor market.\n\"That's a really significant finding,\" said David Blustein, a counseling psychology professor at Boston College's Lynch School of Education. \"What politicians have been telling us about immigrants taking our jobs is not shared by the American people,\" he said.\n\"It seems to me that people see that diversity helps the American worker,\" said Zoe Baird, president of the Markle Foundation.\nIn fact, 85 percent of survey respondents of all ages said it was either extremely or very important for employees to be able to work with colleagues from different backgrounds, with 62 percent adults under the age of 30 saying that continual training and educational will be essential to their career advancement.\n\"It definitely is a very linear relationship there,\" said Kim Parker, director of social trends research at Pew Research Center and one of the lead authors of the report.\nIt's a learning economy\nThese findings reflect the extent to which the most promising jobs are grounded in or depend on constantly evolving technology, Parker said. \"So many of them are technologically based and the technology is constantly changing,\" she said.\nToday's millennials grew up with rapid obsolescence as an expected part of the technological life cycle, which shapes their expectations, Parker added. \"It's a little more part of their DNA. Also, they have a longer trajectory ahead of them,\" Baird said.\n\"People are recognizing that we have a learning economy and that they will be learning and training throughout their lives, and people are embracing this,\" said.\nAutomation fears\nThe survey also found that Americans today are leery of foreign imports but think that exporting to other countries is a plus, and welcome technological improvements in the workplace but worry about robots replacing human workers.\n\"We're seeing a lot of the jobs at the lower-middle level being replaced with automation or outsourced,\" Blustein said.\nThis development is a double-edged sword, Blustein said. \"Automation in general will reduce the amount of tedium at work; however, for people with lower-level skills, these are often the options they might have.\"\nMore than 70 percent of survey respondents think workers themselves bear a lot of the responsibility for keeping abreast of the skills and training they need to acquire over the course of their careers, but the rising cost of this education \u2014 and the question of who ultimately will bear it \u2014 is one that vexes students, workers and policymakers alike.\n\"They're doing this and taking responsibility for it,\" Baird said, but right now, people's individual efforts aren't being matched on a bureaucratic or corporate scale. \"Now we need to catch up in our institutions,\" she said.\nThe learning tree\nSince the Great Recession, \"The relationship of who pays for higher education has changed,\" Smith said, with more of the burden shifted from government and employers and onto the individual.\nA recent analysis of Department of Education data by The Institute for College Access and Success found that the percentage of students with loans who default on that debt is inching down, but the total number of borrowers in default, 8.1 million, is at a record high.\n\"The challenge is I think that we need to think carefully and creatively how we can train people who might not want to go to college,\" Blustein said. He and other labor market experts point to pilot programs in the United States and abroad that incorporate apprenticeships, individualized learning modalities and job-training that targets skills rather than academic tracks.\nThese experts say this needs to be a multifaceted effort, though. \"Part of the burden should fall on the community, on the employers and on the government,\" Smith said. \"It's my opinion that most recently, employers have shirked on that responsibility,\" she said, an observation borne out by the booming \"gig\" economy and the proliferation of contract and temporary employment.\n\"Employers have the other hand,\" Smith said, but this is likely to change as labor market demand grows. \"As jobs get tight again and employers find themselves competing again, the upper hand will shift,\" she predicted.\nAlready, a shortage of workers in some industries is prompting employers to provide more robust training for workers, Parker said. \"There does seem to be a sense, just anecdotally, that the more they can accommodate the needs of their workers, they more they'll have loyalty and retention,\" she said.", "Whatever, Roger.

Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals. Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels,\" Donald Trump said on Saturday according to prepared remarks for his Portsmouth, New Hampshire speech. \nPresident Obama is not flooding the streets with drug kingpins, as Donald Trump alleges, and Hillary Clinton has not voiced support for doing anything similar. \nThe president has commuted the sentences of a record number of nonviolent drug offenders, like a 25-year-old convicted of selling LSD while following the Grateful Dead on tour and sentenced to life in prison. He will now be released in 2018. The commutations are designed to combat long, draconian, drug sentencing. \nSome with longer criminal records have benefited from Obama's policy, like one Miami dealer who oversaw several drug dealers and had weapons charges on this record. His sentence was reduced from life in prison to 30 years; he'll be released sometime after 2035. The White House says all applicants for commutation are evaluated \"to determine that an applicant is ready to make use of his or her second chance.\" \nLast year, the federal government \u2014 prompted not by Obama but an independent body that unanimously approved lowering sentencing charges \u2014 also released 6,000 prisoners convicted of drug-related charges released early after being deemed not to be a threat to society by judges. That's not tens of thousands, as Trump alleges, but the administration did say as many as 40,000 could become eligible for similar early release programs in the coming years. \nAs for his suggestion that these are \"illegal immigrants\" with cartel ties? All non-U.S. citizens (roughly one in three) face deportation or deportation hearings. 2 days ago Trump Ditched the Teleprompters \u2014 Here Are 6 Facts He Blurred \n1. \"Crooked Hillary is giving you a big tax increase, your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nThis is only true if Trump's crowd is full of rich folks: Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners. \n2. Clinton deleted emails \"to cover up her crimes.\" \nClinton deleted 33,000 emails, thousands of which were found on other servers. FBI Director James Comey said, \"We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\" \n3. \"I pay contractors on time, I am so good.\" \nHundreds of contractors including cabinet makers, dishwashers, waitresses and more have alleged that their bills were not paid. One such contractor, a piano manufacturer, said the quality of his work was never contested by the Trump Organization. They simply said they were \"short on funds\" and would only pay 70 percent of the bill. \n4. \"Murders in the United States are up 45 \u2014 did you see the numbers \u2014 the highest they've been in 45 years. Murder's the highest it's been in 45 years.\" \nIt's not, though the murder rate hike is at its highest point in 45 years. \n5. Trump said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency endorsed him. \nAgain: They did not; a union of some of their employees did. \n6. \"[The military has] fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where they're on display. They have to plane graveyards because they don't make the parts anymore. \" \nThere's some truth to Trump's statement. Politifact reached out to a range of third-party experts and found that some military jets are more than 20 years old. But that's not to say that the U.S. military doesn't invest in new planes for its forces. What Trump Got Right and Wrong On Friday \nHere's what Trump got wrong, and right, in his Friday afternoon speech. \n1. \"Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nUnless Trump's crowd is filled with extremely wealthy Americans, their taxes will not go \"way down.\" \nThe wealthy would see the biggest tax cut under Trump's plan, according to the conservative Tax Foundation's analysis. The bottom 80% of Americans, would see 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent more after-tax income thanks to Trump's tax cuts. The richest 1 percent of Americans would see income gains between 10 percent and 16 percent. \n2. \"Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep, but really she's just resting.\" \nIt's true that Clinton doesn't have any publicly scheduled events until after the debate, but there is no evidence she is napping. She prepares at length: For a previous debate , Clinton hunkered down in hotels near her home for day-long sessions of debate prep with her advisors, often working until very late at night. \n3. \"Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress\u2026and she said get rid of 'em, delete 'em, bleach 'em, nobody bleaches because it's such an expensive process, she bleaches them, and then she made everyone get rid of iPhones, hammer them.\" \nClinton requested that 33,000 emails deemed personal by her team be deleted weeks before the Congressional subpoena; she did not stop their deletion, but it was not a direct response to the subpoena. She did not use an expensive process to delete her emails. She used a free app called BleachBit. Some of her mobile phones were destroyed with a hammer, but that was also not a response to the Congressional subpoena. \n4. Trump said Qatar gave $1 million dollars for \"Bill Clinton's birthday party.\" \nThe Emirate gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million dollars as a birthday present; that money went towards charitable acts, not festivities. \n5. \"WikiLeaks shows media conspires with the campaign, including giving the questions and answers before the debate.\" \nCNN and DNC Chair Donna Brazile deny that a debate question was ever given to the Clinton campaign, though an email does appear to show a question being offered up by Brazile to the Clinton campaign. \n6. \"I have no idea who these women are,\" Trump said of the women who have come forward to accuse him of improper sexual advances and groping. \nThis has become a routine denial for Trump, but months before he started denying he knew a Miss Utah who accused him of kissing her on the lips without consent, he argued that she'd personally recanted the story and that she was a \"nice girl.\" \n7. \"Biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\" ", "Trump, Clinton look to final debate 8:45 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/787588675657\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nIf Donald Trump wants to check out the latest attack ad against him, he'll have to visit Michigan -- and learn Arabic. \nThat's because a billboard written in Arabic in Dearborn, Michigan -- which has a large Arab-American population -- is taking aim at the Republican presidential nominee, taunting him in a language he doesn't understand for his antagonism toward Muslims. \nRelated: Experts Say Trump's Muslim Ban Would Cripple Immigration System \n\"Donald Trump, he can't read this, but he is afraid of it,\" reads the black-and-white billboard created by the Nuisance Committee super PAC, which is based in Chicago. The sign, which went up late last week, directs viewers to trumpisscared.org , which gives a short history of Trump's controversial statements on immigration. \nTrump has called for suspending immigration \"from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism\" \u2014 a somewhat evolved version of his previous call to ban Muslims from entering the country entirely. The billboard by the Nuisance Committee super PAC sits on I-94 in Dearborn, Mich. Mike Rogowski \nMelissa Harris, a spokeswoman for the Nuisance Committee, which was launched by Cards Against Humanity creator Max Temkin, told NBC News that Dearborn was chosen because it's in a swing state and because of its large Arab-American population. Because it's written in Arabic, the billboard encourages those who don't speak the language but are curious about its message to reach out to a friend to find out. \n\"We want to make sure everyone that's registered to vote goes to vote. We want them to stand up and be heard,\" Harris added. \"We were trying to highlight in a clever way the ridiculousness of Donald's Trump position on immigration,\" which she called \"abhorrent, un-American and hateful.\" \nThe Trump campaign did not return a request for comment about the billboard, which sits on I-94. Harris said more than 331,000 people see the billboard \u2014 which will be up for the next month \u2014 on a weekly basis. \nFor their part, members of the Muslim-American community in Dearborn said the billboard was effective. \nHassan Al-Qaqwini, an imam at the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, said, \"I believe that the billboard shows some sarcasm, but it is also sending a message on how uneducated Donald Trump and his followers are about Islam and the Muslim committee, how little they know about our religion. I think it's a true message and a powerful message as well.\" \nNasser Beydoun, chairman of the Arab-American Civil Rights League in Dearborn, echoed that sentiment. \"Nothing about Donald Trump is funny. But the message is what's important here, and that's everyone needs to come together to defeat racism and bigotry and demagoguery here the United States.\" Aliyah Frumin ", "Oct 21 2016, 9:10 am ET Woman Indicted for Hate Crime After Allegedly Stealing $160,000 in 'Blessing Scam' by Chris Fuchs advertisement \nA Chinese woman was indicted in New York on hate crime charges for allegedly scamming two other Chinese woman out of $160,000 in cash and jewelry, the Brooklyn district attorney announced Thursday. \nXuekun Su, 44, is accused in two separate incidents of convincing the women in Brooklyn that their families were cursed and that to rid them of it, they needed to place cash and jewels in a bag to be blessed, the district attorney said. Suspects sought by NYPD charged with conducting \"blessing scams\" NYPD \nIn one instance in April, $140,000 in cash and 24-karat gold jewelry were allegedly stolen before the bag was given back to the 61-year-old Chinese immigrant, with instructions not to open it for days, prosecutors said. \nThe same evening, however, the woman looked inside and discovered that her money and valuables were missing, the district attorney said. Prosecutors said the woman was promised that the cash and jewelry would be given back following the blessing. \nAt her arraignment Thursday in Brooklyn Supreme Court, Su pleaded not-guilty to an eight-count indictment, her attorney told NBC News, which included charges of second-, third-, and fourth-degree grand larceny as a hate crime. \"In this case, the theory is that the victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, because they were Chinese, and because of their religious practices, their religious spiritual beliefs.\" \nHelen Peterson, a spokeswoman for the DA's office, told NBC News that prosecutors can charge a hate crime if a victim is targeted because of ethnicity, race, or religious beliefs. Hate crime charges in New York State increase the punishment if convicted. \n\"In this case, the theory is that the victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, because they were Chinese, and because of their religious practices, their religious spiritual beliefs,\" Peterson said. \nSu faces up to 25 years in prison if found guilty of the indictment's top count, the district attorney's office said. \nJustice Danny Chun set bail at $150,000 cash, or $250,000 bond, according to the district attorney. Su's attorney, Morris Shamuil, said Su has no funds or assets to post bail and remains behind bars. \nHe added that Su had also been charged in a similar case in the borough of Queens. She's due back in Brooklyn Supreme Court on Dec. 21. \nRELATED: Brooklyn DA Charges 3 With Alleged $85,000 Theft in 'Blessing Scam' \nShamuil said he told the judge at the arraignment Thursday that Su was smuggled from China into the U.S. based on promises of being given a job, earning money, and receiving legal immigration status. He added she was forced to do things she didn't agree to in exchange for food and shelter. \n\"She was not aware of what she would have to do,\" he said. \"She didn't know what the price was until she got to America.\" \nShamuil also said he was surprised by and disagreed with the hate crime charges, adding that both his client and the alleged victims are Chinese. \n\"I have not ever seen anything like this done before, in terms of making grand larceny as a hate crime,\" he said.

The woman, who was told that a member of her family would die from a curse, gathered around $19,000 in cash and pieces of 24-karat gold jewelry to be blessed. \nShe, too, was promised that her money and jewelry would be returned, according to prosecutors. It was only later that the woman realized what she had handed over was gone from the bag, prosecutors said. \nThe hate crime charges against Su come a little more than a month after the Brooklyn district attorney announced an indictment related to another alleged blessing scam. In that one, two women and a man were charged with stealing $85,000 in cash and jewelry that a Chinese senior citizen allegedly handed over to be blessed to remove a death curse. \nThey and Su were also arrested in August in connection with similar incidents in Manhattan and Queens, according to DNAinfo . Documentation related by the NYPD warning community members about \"blessing scams.\" \nThe so-called \"blessing scam\" has been around in U.S. Chinese communities for years, with victims targeted in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, and Hawaii, according to NBC New York . Following a rash of such cases in New York City, the New York Police Department began a public awareness campaign in 2013, hitting the streets and tacking up posters in Chinese and English to warn residents. \n\"This is the second blessing scam we've indicted in as many months, in which brazen con men and women walk off with the life savings of their victims,\" Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said in a statement. \"I urge those in the Chinese community to warn their vulnerable family members to be aware of these scams to avoid falling prey to them.\" \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Throughout the 90 minutes, Trump limited the interruptions that played poorly in the first debate, but Clinton's dig at him while talking about the Social Security payroll tax apparently pushed him over the edge. \nRelated: Trump Won't Say He'll Accept Election Results: 'I Will Keep You In Suspense' \nClinton said her payroll taxes would go up, and so would Trump's, unless he found a way to avoid it. Trump has not released his tax returns but has admitted, following reporting by the \"New York Times,\" that he didn't pay taxes for decades after reportedly taking a near-$1 billion loss in 1995. \nThe GOP nominee then leaned into his microphone and interrupted, \"such a nasty woman.\" \nIt was a moment that stunned even observers inured to Trump's often brutal rhetoric.

Searches for \"is Bernie Sanders a write in candidate\" rose 2,750 percent and searches for \"write in Mike Pence\" grew 2,400 percent the same week. Other candidates searched include Mitt Romney and Evan McMullin. \nThe highest interest is in New Jersey, Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. All of these states allow write-in candidates. \nWrite-in votes accounted for 0.11 percent of the vote in 2012.

( \"Access Hollywood\" is owned and distributed by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC.) \nThe tape, in which Trump is heard boasting about attempting to seduce a married woman, sparked backlash within the GOP and beyond. \n\"I think we all know guys who have had conversations with other guys that go a little bit in that direction. That's a fact of life,\" Trump Jr. said. \nHe asked voters to realize that his father hadn't \"spent his whole life\" being a politician. \n\"He hasn't spent his whole life polishing every statement he's ever made and every conversation he's ever had. He doesn't run a focus group so he can tell you what he's thinking. He speaks from the heart,\" Trump Jr. said, jabbing Clinton for differences in her public and private statements that he said came to light in the leaked emails from her chief of staff, John Podesta. \nOf the string of sexual misconduct allegations that have been waged against him, Trump Jr. said, \"Obviously, he's not happy\" about them. \nTrump Jr. said felt his father could still relate to \"ordinary Americans\" better on \"many cases\" than Hillary Clinton. a day ago Suspicious Substance Sent to Clinton Campaign HQ Deemed 'Non-Hazardous' \nOffices of Hillary Clinton's campaign headquarters in New York were evacuated on Friday evening after receiving a letter with a \"white powdered substance,\" according to officials. \nThe entire 11th floor was cleared around 5:30 p.m. ET after the unknown substance arrived in a business size envelope to Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters, the NYPD's Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information (DCPI) told NBC News. \n\"Preliminary testing by federal and local officials has found the substance to be non-hazardous. The four individuals involved have reported no health issues and, following a full examination by medical personnel, were each released to go home,\" said Clinton spokesperson Glen Caplin. \"Our office remained open throughout this period and will remain open without interruption tomorrow morning .\" ", "\nI've been, oh go ahead. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nWell, I actually think that, that that's exactly right. And because the crisis in the Republican party is garnering all the headlines, that Democrats are overlooking the looming crisis in their party, because I think the primary between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Cl-- Hillary Clinton really showed that Hillary Clinton is where the head of the Democratic party is, but the people really are with Bernie Sanders, particularly on trade. \nAnd you saw Tim Kaine say, \"Well, no, I'm-- we're definitely not for T.P.P. An Asian trade agreement? Yeah, we're probably for that.\" But you know, the Democratic party's, their heart is against that. And it's going to be a bloody fight. And the same is true in the Republican party. \nYAMICHE ALCINDOR: \nI've been talking to Repub-- to progressives all week that are telling me that they're already organizing against Hillary Clinton as if she were a Republican president. They're looking at her saying, \"We're going to have to push her every step of the way. And we don't trust her.\" So this idea about T.P.P., they're not going to like Tim Kaine's answer. I watched him and listened to him and they're thinking to themselves that \"I don't-- I don't trust these people. I don't know what they're going to do when they get in there.\" \nCHUCK TODD: \nBoy, part-- \nTOM FRIEDMAN: \nThe irony Chuck is that T.P.P. represents the single greatest liberal achievement on trade since we've negotiated trade agreements. The first deal that has real labor protection and real environmental protection. And that's exactly what Obama will be selling the morning after. \nCHUCK TODD: \nIronically, Stu, and I've actually had some Democrats say this to me, and especially in this issue, if you are Hillary Clinton, secretly you may hope Paul Ryan is still the Speaker of the House. That you need one Republican majority to basically tell progressives, \"This is as far as I can go.\" \nSTUART STEVENS: \nWell, what's extraordinary about this debate on trade is that the Republican is really to the left of the Democrat. \nCHUCK TODD: \nRight. \nSTUART STEVENS: \nI mean, he's up there saying, \"Bernie Sanders was right, and he wants 45% tariffs.\" It's like, \"Well, whoa, whoa, whoa.\" So I don't-- I think it would be good to have someone like Paul Ryan there who can argue a more conservative viewpoint of why we need this. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAll right, let's go into some numbers. And Stuart, I really want to get your reaction to this. We got some early voting numbers here, it's a reminder people are already voting. Over four million people have already cast their ballot in this election so far. And we know the partisan breakdown of these voters. And you can see how the candidates are stacking up to years past. \nSo a data that was partially provided by a Democratic firm called TargetSmart, Florida's absentee vote so far, both Republicans and Democrats are pulling about the same numbers here, how the party's voted, Stuart, 42, 42, 39, 39. So at-- to 40, about the same. But look at these North Carolina numbers. Republicans accounted for 50 percent of all absentee vote in 2012, while Democrats accounted for just 28 percent of the absentee vote. Now it's much closer, 40 to 35. It's proof that it looks like the Democrats have the mechanic advantage. \nSTUART STEVENS: \nYeah, you know, all of our modeling in political politics, presidential politics breaks from basically two equal campaigns. We've never had a situation where-- the Trump campaign really doesn't have much of an organization. It's more of a concert tour. And it, it-- what are the implications of that? Now some have argued, as Trump did in the primary, it doesn't really matter. We're really going to see the first test of that. \nBecause say what you will about the Clinton campaign, they have designed a very effective machine with top people. And I think that Republicans are greatly disadvantaged in these states, because we never went through the steps to the presidential campaign of raising money and giving it to the states to bill this. So we'll see how it plays out. And these early numbers are the best indicator. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAnd Eliana, how, how much panic do you hear from Sen-- Senate candidates? I mean, if you're Richard Burr, that-- that's got to freak you out. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nAbsolutely. You know, I would add one note of caution about these early-voting numbers in that all-- we don't know how any of these people went into the ballot box and actually pulled the lever. \nCHUCK TODD: \nOf course, this is just partisan-- Right. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nThey're just based on the party somebody's affiliated with. And one of the things people have speculated about is are Democrat-- Democrats going to vote like traditional Democrats, union voters trending toward Trump, are Republicans going to vote like traditional Republicans? \nSo just a note of caution on that. But, you know, to Stu's point, this is like a political science experiment in whether ground game matters. And what I've heard from Senate candidates are they essentially have had to build up presidential-type ground games in each and every state. And that's tremendously difficult to do. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAll right, I'm going to wrap this up here. But we'll know on Election Day if, if her lead increases from what the national polls say, then it'll tell us I think that ground games do matter. All right, when we come back, it was the Beach Boys who sang, \"Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world.\" Well, if the Democrats catch a wave on Election Day, could they wind up sitting on top of the Senate and the House? That's next. But first, a little more from last night's S.N.L. \n(BEGIN TAPE) \nSo you're just never going to answer a question about your emails? \nKATE MCKINNON: \nNo, but it was very cute to watch you try. \n(END TAPE) \n* * *COMMERCIAL BREAK* * * \nCHUCK TODD: \nAnd we are back, data download time. Hillary Clinton is holding onto a solid lead in the presidential race. So Democrats are looking to run up the score down the ballot. Their chances to take back the Senate already look pretty good. But what would turn 2016 into an actual wave election that could help Democrats get the 30 seats they would need to win a House majority? \nWell, our pal Dave Wasserman of the Cook Political Report rated these 19 House districts across the country as pure toss-up races. Of these 19, 17 are currently held by Republicans, just two by Democrats. So if this does become a wave election, Democrats would probably win the lion's share of those races. \nSo, throw those in. Add in several seats that Democrats are likely to win largely because of redistricting that took place in Florida and Virginia and the Democrats could net 21 seats just in those two categories. However, for this truly to be a wave election, Democrats are going to have to score some upsets in places Republicans normally win. \nSo these are the 12 lean Republican races across the country. There are three that I'm going to pay special attention to on election night. They're my canaries in the coal mine. The House seats in Kansas City, Kansas, Des Moines, Iowa, and Indiana's ninth district, which includes Bloomington in Indiana and the suburbs around Louisville, Kentucky. These are going to be the, the races to watch to see if Democrats win two of these three or all three of them, then we will, it will tell you a lot about moderate Republican turnout that may have not been there, which could in turn mean a bad night for the Republicans across the board. \nWe did see big waves in 2006 when the Democrats took back the House and the Senate, and in 2010 when Republicans flipped the House back by a huge margin. Yet, despite of all of this, history may not be on the Democrats' side. The last time the House of Representatives changed hands in a presidential election year, 1952. So ask yourself, is this an Eisenhower wave that's coming? When we come back, we'll talk about whether there is a real possibility to rig a general election in the United States. But as we go to break, here's another light moment from last night's S.N.L. \n(BEGIN TAPE) \nAll of the newscasters are making me look so bad. \nTOM HANKS: \nAnd how are we doing that? \nALEC BALDWIN: \nBy taking all of the things I say and all of the things I do and putting them on TV. \n(END TAPE) \n* * *COMMERCIAL BREAK.* * * \nCHUCK TODD: \nBack now with our panel. Before we get to this election rigging stuff, I want to talk about what I just did in the Data Download, the House, it's a long shot. Not since 52 has the house changed hands in a presidential election year. So, if it does, who leads the Republican party, Tom? \nTOM FRIEDMAN: \nI think, you know, I find myself with two minds when I think of that Chuck. One is, you'd like to have Republicans have skin in the game. Both for the reasons you talked about, to discipline the left-wing of the Democratic party but also that we can't get anything big done without that. But I have another mind, that maybe this party needs to crash and burn. This version of the Republican party needs to die. So out of the ashes, just as a new Democratic party came out of the post-McGovern, post-Dukakis era, that we will get a Democratic leadership council movement, a sane Republican party. \nCHUCK TODD: \nThere you go. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nThat is going to happen regardless, whether Republicans lose the House. You're seeing that happen right now. \nCHUCK TODD: \nBut seventy-five percent of the party are Trump voters, it's only 25 percent that think the way you think, right Eliana? \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nWell, what I think's going to happen is the party is crashing and burning right now and Donald Trump, I think, will preach to the converted after the election but the party is going to have to -- Trump supporters, I think, haven't gotten the attention that they deserve from the party. And the party's going to grapple with how to incorporate Trump supporters and parts of Trump-ism, on trade and immigration in particular, and I think that needs to happen. I think both parties have neglected these voters. Many of them are former Democrats. \nCHUCK TODD: \nWhat's best for the Republican party, total collapse? Or keep Paul Ryan there to be the guy that, sort of---- \nSTUART STEVENS: \nI think where the Republican party goes is totally up in the air. But it's got to be reality based. I mean I just keep going back to this, in 1980 when Ronald Reagan won 44 states with 56 percent white vote. Mitt Romney got 59 percent in 2012 and lost. So, you know, a lot of these conversations here about the Republican party are like -- on the interstate you've got to drive 100 miles, 40 miles of gas, and you're debating whether or not you should stop for gas. The car doesn't care. It's going to stop. And Republicans either have to decide that we can reach out to more non-white voters and win presidential elections or not. There's really no alternative. \nYAMICHE ALCINDOR: \nWhen I go to these rallies for Pence and for Donald Trump and I talk to people, they really don't feel as though the Republican party really stuck with them. They feel like the party just doesn't understand the anxiety that they're feeling, both about the economy and also about healthcare, and what they're going to take care of their families. And in some ways, they sound like people who voted for Obama. I was working on some things, talking to people about whether or not they voted for Obama, and people were like, even with him there was going to be change and the economy was going to be better. So the Republican party, 75 percent of them, don't sound like the people that the establishment says they are. \nCHUCK TODD: \nWell, it's interesting that you bring that up. Look, Iowa and Ohio are the two states that haven't sort of -- where Hillary Clinton hasn't taken off during this spell. That means, Eliana, there are Obama voters from '12, who when they painted Mitt Romney as the guy who fired you, you know, that voted Obama over him, and those people are with Trump, because he's talking the way Obama talked about Romney. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nYeah, I think there's not an enormous segment, but a significant segment of the electorate that feels when Trump talks about a rigged election, that doesn't feel necessarily that the election is going to be rigged, but that the system is rigged against them, that they haven't gotten the attention from either party that they deserve. \nAnd I think that's scorned by at least in both parties. And I don't think to Stu's point that the debate is over whether or not the Republican party needs to reach out to minority voters or to these voters, but it's how to do that. It's is immigration reform the magic bullet or does moderating some of the party's stances on entitlement reform or the welfare state, is that a more constructive way to do it? \nCHUCK TODD: \nYou know, Tom, it does seem as if, and I thought one of your compatriots on the op-ed page this morning, Ross Douthat, I thought he had an interesting, he said, \"The risks with Hillary Clinton is this idea of group think about globalization.\" It was among the risks. And this is what some skeptical Trump people, who still may vote for him, are thinking about, that you know what, maybe she's not going to rethink how globalism works. \nTOM FRIEDMAN: \nWell, I would take it one step deeper, if I could Chuck. I think we're in the middle of the single greatest technological inflection point since Gutenberg invented the printing press. I think the workplace is fundamentally being transformed. And what Bill Clinton said back in 1992 just doesn't apply anymore. \nWhat did he say in that convention, \"If you work hard, play by the rules, you should be in the middle class.\" Well, good luck with that. Today you have to work harder, relearn faster, retool, reengineer. And, you know, Eliana went to daughter with my college-- college with my daughter, which shows how old I am. Okay? And I always used to say, \"When I graduate from college, I got to find a job.\" \nWhen my daughters graduate from college, they have to invent a job. That's what's new. All right? And then, you may get lucky and get your first job, but you've got to invent, reinvent. And nobody wants to trust the people with that truth. Because it's really scary. \nCHUCK TODD: \nDoes the Clinton campaign get this? \nYAMICHE ALCINDOR: \nIt's hard to say if they get this, because if you hear them talking about the economy, or like, and if you hear them talking about giving people opportunities, they still believe that if you go to college, or if you do this. It sounds like they're saying, \"You can have the--\" \nCHUCK TODD: \nSounds like Bill Clinton. \nYAMICHE ALCINDOR: \nIt sounds like Clinton-- This is an America that you can have. There is this American dream. But then when you talk to people who have four degrees or master's programs and they can't find jobs, or they're living in the basements of their parents' house, those are people who maybe voted for Bernie Sanders, or maybe those are people who are solid Trump supporters. Those people overlap in their life experiences. \nCHUCK TODD: \nAll right, let me take a quick pause here, 45 seconds with our endgame segment, including something that hasn't happened since Harry Truman's first year in office. \n***COMMERCIAL BREAK*** \nCHUCK TODD:Back now with End Game. Despite all the talk about Hillary Clinton wanting to work across the aisle or what we've been talking about here. About should Paul Ryan stay or go? What's better for the Republican party? It's clear politically, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama both are looking for a wave. Look at how much President Obama is suddenly appearing in down ballot TV ads. Here's a little montage. \n(BEGIN TAPE) \nBARACK OBAMA:Terri's running for Congress and we need a lot more people like her in Washington. \nBARACK OBAMA: \nVote for Brad Schneider and the Democrats so we can keep America's promise to our seniors. \nBARACK OBAMA: \nSalga Y vote por Patrick. Su voto es muy importante. Gracias amigos. \nBARACK OBAMA: \nCharlie needs your vote. Please stand with him. I know he'll always stand with you. \n(END TAPE) \nCHUCK TODD: \nYou know, Stuart, this reminds me a little bit of Mitt Romney 2014. He became popular enough to use-- \nSTUART STEVENS: \nYep. \nCHUCK TODD: \n--in all of these down ballot ads. Barack Obama, sitting with anywhere from a 53 to 57 percent approval rating. He's suddenly popular in swing state ads. \nSTUART STEVENS:It's a, it's a huge advantage for any party to have a popular incumbent president. It's one of the few ways that you can elect a third term of someone in the White House. If you're a Clinton advance person, it's a sweet spot to be in for the next few weeks, because you can call up Bill Clinton. They say, \"Do you want the president, do you want the first lady, do you want Bernie Sanders, do you want Bill Clinton? How about Joe Biden?\" You can build a rally with those people. And they each have constituencies. And it's really starkly different when you see what's happening with the Trump campaign and who he's traveling with. It limits their audience appeal. \nCHUCK TODD: \nEliana, how are these Senate candidates handling this? That suddenly President Obama is playing a pretty mean-- he called out Marco Rubio at events, she's calling out Pat Toomey. I mean, this has to make that vice grip a little bit tighter. \nELIANA JOHNSON: \nWell, I think Republican candidates are constrained not only by Democratic strengths, but by Trump's weaknesses because a lot of polling shows that Republican voters and Democratic voters want a check on a Clinton presidency. But Republican candidates can't say that. There's a segment of Trump voters who will spurn them and vote against them, threaten to vote against them, if they do say that. So they cannot go out and campaign on, on essentially conceding the election to Hillary Clinton. The N.R.S.C. is now running ads on Republican Senate candidates being in check to Clinton. But I don't think that's going to be enough. I think if they were going to do that, they'd have to say it forthrightly. And they cannot do that. \nCHUCK TODD: \nLook, you-- Nevada Senate, Tom. Joe Heck, the Republican nominee, he came out against when Trump, when the sexual-assault language came out, he said, \"You know what, my--\" basically, he said it was personal for him. His wife had been a victim of sexual assault. And he just couldn't do it. Apparently he hasn't led in a poll since. That Trump voters are punishing him, I mean, that's a vice grip. \nTOM FRIEDMAN: \nYeah, and I think what is even scarier, Chuck, is what happens if Trump loses after the election? Which Donald Trum-- And people say he's going to start his own media company and be constantly then terrorizing the Republican party from the right. This should be very interesting. You see a real tension between Trump ink, I-N-K, and Trump Inc., I-N-C okay? Because look, the United States Golf Association next year I think is holding the women's U.S. Open at a Trump Golf Course. \nCHUCK TODD: ", "4 hours ago Trump Cites Police, Military, ICE Endorsements That Didn't Happen \nOn Monday, Donald Trump told News4Jax that the United States military \"conceptually\" endorsed him and that \"virtually every police department\" in the country backed his bid for the presidency. During last week's third debate, Trump said his hardline stance on immigration and pledge to build a border wall had earned him an endorsement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. a day ago Trump Claims Media Isn't Asking Kaine About Catholics. They Are \nTrump asked on Twitter why Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine, a practicing Catholic, was not being asked about the hacked WikiLeaks emails that appear to show Clinton campaign staffers mocking Catholicism. \nKaine has been asked about them in nearly every national TV interview he's done in the last week. \nHe was asked about this twice last Sunday ABC's This Week and Fox News Sunday , CNBC two days later , and was pressed on the same issue on NBC News' Meet the Press yesterday. Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win! 2 days ago No, ISIS Isn't Rooting for Clinton \nISIS is \"dreaming that Hillary Clinton becomes President. ISIS, their number one dream, Hillary Clinton, let her become President. She's the one that allowed it to form, she's the one that watched it go, now they say it's in 32 countries, worse than ever.\"A dozen interviews with ISIS extremists and a review of their social media networks by Foreign Affairs magazine found that the terrorist group has a strong preference in the 2016 election: they'd like to see Donald Trump elected, not Clinton. \nFact checkers have also reviewed Trump's repeated claim that ISIS' rise is directly Clinton's fault and declared it to be false . 3 days ago Trump Cites Pew Study as Proof of Fraud, But Study Doesn't Find It \n\"According to the highly respected Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate ... There are 1.8 million dead people that are registered right now to vote. And folks, folks, some of them vote,\" Trump said Saturday night while calling the election \"rigged.\" \nThis 2012 Pew study notes that the voter rolls are wildly out of date and advocates for modernizing the system to save taxpayer money. It finds no proof of voter fraud; the study's only mention of voter fraud is merely that error-riddled voter logs lead to the \"perception\" of being susceptible to fraud. \nIn practice, experts say widespread voter fraud just doesn't exist. Poll observers say that if a voter moves to another state or dies, they don't vote twice and aren't likely to be impersonated. A Loyola researcher who reviewed a billion ballots found 31 credible cases of voter fraud . 4 days ago Yup, the Investor's Business Daily Poll Was the Most Accurate in 2012 \nDonald Trump likes to blur the polls. He's boasted of winning ones that didn't exist, and earlier this week he said he'd won every single post-debate online tally \u2014 not true, since our own NBC News/Survey Monkey showed Hillary Clinton winning and even Breitbart's survey said the same for a time \u2014 so when Trump started talking up the credentials of a lesser-known poll, our fact checker's ear was piqued. \n\"We're leading in three recent polls the last day: Rasmussen, LA Times, Investor's Business Daily. The last one was the most accurate poll of the last cycle, so that's a good sign!\" he said. \nSure enough, Trump's spot on here: Investor's Business Daily was indeed the most accurate poll of 2012 among the more prolific pollsters. He's leading Clinton by just one point in the national poll of 789 likely voters \u2014 within the margin of error to be sure \u2014 but leading nonetheless. No, the World Doesn't Hate Obama and America \n\"The world hates our president, and the world hates us.\" Trump 10/21/2016 \nTrump repeatedly said the U.S. is run by \"babies\" and \"losers\" today, deriding the president and his wife who have campaigned for his rival at length. But his claim that the world hates President Barack Obama, and the U.S. in general, is false. \n\"Barack Obama continues to enjoy a broad degree of international popularity,\" a Pew Global report found this summer, noting particularly strong popularity in Europe and Asia. The Middle East, where the U.S. is still involved militarily, has lower favorability ratings for the U.S. What's more, the U.S. isn't poorly viewed: a median of 69% view the U.S. favorably, with 24 percent expressing an unfavorable view in another Pew Global study from last year. 4 days ago Trump Claims Michelle Obama Dissed Hillary Clinton in '08 Primary. She Didn't. \n\"We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks. We have a bunch of losers. They're losers. They're babies. We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign. And I see how much his wife likes Hillary, but wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, 'If you can't take care of your home,' right? 'You can't take care of the White House or the country.' Where's that? I don't hear that. I don't hear that. She's the one that started that. I said, 'We can't say that. It's too vicious.' Can you believe it? I said that. We can't say it. They said, 'Well, Michelle Obama said it.' I said, 'She did?' Now she said that, but we don't hear about that.\" Trump, 10/21/2016 \nIn the 2008 Democratic primary, Michelle Obama spoke about her own family while campaigning for her husband in Chicago: \"One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.\" \nMrs. Obama made similar remarks at a campaign stop in Iowa, talking about the importance of family and how she and Barack Obama managed their careers with raising kids. When those comments were interpreted at a swipe at Clinton, the then-Illinois senator denied that they had anything to do with President Bill Clinton's notorious infidelities. \nTrump made a similar claim in the second debate , suggesting that Mrs. Obama's words had been used as a campaign ad in the 2008 primary. They weren't. The only campaign ad that's used those words are a pro-Trump ad cut by a super PAC this year. 5 days ago Trump Says Clinton Team Promoting Voter Fraud \n\"John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver's license,\" Donald Trump said Thursday, prompting his Delaware crowd to roar angrily. \nOnly Podesta didn't say that. \nIn an email chain about voter ID and voter registration, allegedly from Podesta's personal email account that was hacked and published on WikiLeaks, Podesta appears to suggest that photo ID for same-day registration might be a good way to for them to combat GOP-supported voter ID laws. \nPodesta said voters would need to attest to their citizenship to do so -- something you do any time you register to vote -- he doesn't suggest undocumented immigrants lie in order to register to vote. \nThe conversation is rooted in hypotheticals: one person suggests supporting online voting, another suggests online voter registration. This wasn't campaign scheming as Trump alleges, this was an informal discussion. 6 days ago We Fact Checked the Whole Debate. Here's What We Found. \nIn their third and final debate, the two candidates didn't disappoint our ready and waiting fact check team at NBC News and PolitiFact. In a wild 90-minute debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton brought up dozens of inaccuracies, half truths, and a few surprising truths. ", "Oct 1 2016, 9:32 am ET The 'Shameless' Polyamorous Throuple Next Door by Trish Bendix (L-R) Isidora Goreshter as Svetlana, Shanola Hampton as Veronica Fisher and Steve Howey as Kevin Ball in \"Shameless.\" Cliff Lipson / SHOWTIME Share advertisement \nShowtime's family comedy, \"Shameless,\" has quietly been one of the most boundary pushing shows on premium cable, especially when it comes to sex and relationships. The Gallaghers and their extended chosen family of friends are some of the queerest to ever exist, with Ian's coming out and subsequent relationships with men, Monica's leaving Frank for a butch trucker and then later a pixie-haired woman she met while institutionalized, and Debbie's willingness to feign interest in a woman dying of cancer in order to try and seduce her rich husband. \nIn the Gallaghers' world, there are rich lesbians gentrifying the neighborhood and gay teens with guns. For better or for worse, their poor but recently deemed up-and-coming South Side Chicago neighborhood is where lines have been crossed so many times that there's no way to establish where they begin or end\u2014and that's what makes it so fun to watch. \nSeason 7, premiering Sunday on Showtime, will expand on the notions of love and family with the throuple that they established at the latter half of season 6: Veronica (Shanola Hampton), Kevin (Steve Howie) and Svetlana (Isidora Goreshter). The cast of \"Shameless\" on Showtime SHOWTIME \nPolyamorous relationships are still taboo on television with little exploration given to the idea that three (or more) people can be involved romantically and sexually. But on a show like \"Shameless,\" it's almost commonplace for an interracial couple (Kevin and Veronica, or Kev and V to those who know them well) to be partnered parents who then bring Svetlana, a Russian prostitute, to live with them after V marries Svetlana so she can stay in the country. Oh, and they have three babies to raise among them\u2014twin baby girls that Veronica's mom birthed from Kevin's sperm and one son that Svetlana had after getting pregnant by Mickey, Ian's former boyfriend who is now in prison (see: gay teens with guns above). A modern family, indeed. \nSeries regular Shanola Hampton was not thrilled about the idea at first. \n\"I hated it, to be honest with you,\" she said. \"I felt like Kevin and Veronica had been the stability throughout the show. Even when they were going through their marital difficulties and having a relationship, there was still something there that said they would only love one another. So when I saw that that love was sort of being divided or going some place else\u2014wait a minute? Is that true for these characters? I don't know that that's right to me.\" Shanola Hampton as Veronica Fisher and Steve Howey as Kevin Ball in \"Shameless\" on Showtime Paul Sarkis / SHOWTIME \nIt was after she found a way to see how Veronica's love for Kevin wasn't diminished by their mutual relationship with Svetlana that she came to embrace the storyline. \n\"I had to make it make sense in my head,\" Hampton said. \"What happens is sometimes you just meet another person, and it doesn't take away the love that you have for your person\u2014the person that you're in love with. But sometimes there's just this connection that you cannot deny, and a lot of people spend time denying it for all of the right reasons in their head, but it's still there, and something pulled us together.\" \n\"It's such an interesting dynamic between the three of us,\" Goreshter added. \"I think all three of them kind of understand that Kev and V are endgame, and nobody really wants to fuck with that. I think Svetlana has her own\u2014she has her own agenda with what she wants. She's not there to break up a marriage. She's smarter than that.\" \nRELATED: The Pfeffermans Are Perfectly Imperfect in 'Transparent' Season 3 \nWhen season 7 returns, there appears to be a harmonious hum in the threesome's household. They take turns with chores (in all senses of the word) and work together at their dive bar, The Alibi. But the actresses tease that things won't stay sane for long. \n\"It's not as sexy for Kev,\" Hampton said. \"The sex is great, but you now have two women to tell you 'Why didn't you clean up the damn house?' And he's like 'Wait a minute\u2014are ya'll ganging up on me?'\" \nShe likens it to being part of a \"threeway friendship\" at times. \n\"Imagine, you know, you're always like 'Well wait a minute\u2014you didn't tell me that story. Are ya'll closer than we are? I thought we were all best friends!' And then this way it's like we're all married, so 'Why didn't we have this conversation?' And sometimes it comes up the other way where Kevin and Veronica agree on something, and Svetlana is like 'Wait a minute\u2014we're supposed to be in a marriage, and we discuss and go through everything, but now you're not discussing this with me?'\" Hampton said. \"So yeah, a lot of that does come up in the dynamic of being with multiple partners.\" \nA sex worker until very recently, Svetlana seems to prefer women when she's not just using sex to get something specific that she wants. Her attraction to Veronica is made clear in very explicit scenes the women share in season 6, though Goreshter notes Svetlana is not necessarily in the relationship just for the sex. \n\"She's not a robot\u2014she has feelings, and she's incredibly attracted to Veronica. I don't think she would put herself in these sexual positions of vulnerability if there wasn't some sort of element of emotion there,\" Goreshter explained. \"I'm not saying you're seeing the cracks of Svetlana open up, but there definitely is an emotional element to the situation or else she wouldn't be putting herself out there like she is for them.\" \nGoreshter, however, does acknowledge her character's limits: \"I don't know if she's capable of love, because she's been through so much damage, abuse, immigration, prostitution\u2014but it's all part of her core and who she is, and she wouldn't be Svetlana without any of those things in her past.\" \nFor Veronica, the sexual interest in Svetlana may have been less of a surprise than the emotional. \n\"That moment where they're having a beer in bed, and Svetlana is smoking a cigarette, and of all people, Veronica was asking this Russian whore ... how to be a good parent and how to love her child, and that's when I think that you started to see the walls break down for Veronica\u2014because it's hard for her to accept anyone in her life.\" (L-R) Isidora Goreshter as Svetlana, Shanola Hampton as Veronica Fisher and Steve Howey as Kevin Ball in \"Shameless\" on Showtime Cliff Lipson / SHOWTIME \nLast season, Kevin expressed his jealousy over the time Svetlana and Veronica spent together, but Hampton said there has yet to be a moment where V is unhappy with any attention Kevin is giving Svetlana. \n\"I think that she has such a love for the fact that Kevin has allowed this to come into their lives, and really he did it for them, which I think is so sweet and speaks to their love and loyalty that she doesn't [get upset],\" Hampton said. \"She hasn't really been jealous at all.\" \nHaving done some reading on real-life polyamorous relationships, Hampton said that she's found the situation of V, Kev and Svetlana might be a little different from real-life throuples. \n\"It's gotten to the point now where they don't all three have to have sex together, which is interesting, because when doing like research on these relationships, you have to really talk about boundaries and what's acceptable and what's not,\" Hampton explained. \"And a lot of times what's not acceptable is the hooking up when the other person is not there and doesn't know it.\" \nOn most shows that depict polyamory (most recently ABC's \"Mistresses\" and Audience Network's \"You Me Her\"), the drama comes from that very thing\u2014the deceit, the cheating, the lying that most people assume will ultimately push a polyamorous partnership to implode. But on \"Shameless,\" it appears the threat comes in the form of a \"mysterious visitor\" who will clue viewers into Svetlana's past. \n\"That will definitely, definitely play out this season, and you'll definitely see a reaction that Veronica has, which you know she has a strong reaction to most things that don't fit into her structure,\" Hampton said. \"And you'll see Kev kind of go along with those reactions, so it'll be interesting. It's a really cool twist, and you'll get to see the babies' reactions to all of that as well.\" \n\"Shameless\" has the power to normalize situations that might otherwise appear sensational, and this storyline is no different. What might feel forced or provocative on another series is just another beautiful day in the working class neighborhood for the Gallaghers and their circle, who follow how they feel instead of what society dictates for them, and that's why it works so well and delivers so richly in previously unexplored comedy. \n\"My circumstances might be out of the ordinary and ridiculous, but the way we approach the material is so grounded in reality that people can't help but relate to it,\" Goreshter said. \"Even though what we're put through is outlandish, it's grounded, and I think that's why people relate to it so much.\" \nSeason 7 of \"Shameless\" premieres Sunday, Oct. 2, at 9 p.m. on Showtime. \nTrish Bendix is a writer in Los Angeles.

Viktor Orban tours the area where a fence was erected on the Bulgaria-Turkey border on Sept. 14. NIKOLAY DOYCHINOV / AFP - Getty Images \n\"Orban's argument is that the only way of dealing with the migrant issue is by sealing the borders and refusing to give in to what he sees as moral blackmail,\" according to Jonathan Eyal, an associate director at the Royal United Services Institute , a London-based think tank. \"He's not interested in deals, especially not from the European Union.\" \nOrban's campaign is expected to receive the vast majority of votes, the only real hurdle being the 50 percent turnout needed to validate the result. \nHis government's advertising campaign cost upward of $47.3 million \u2014 compared with the $100,000 budget of his opponents \u2014 according to a partial cost seen by The Associated Press. \"We don't want those kinds of migrants, for obvious reasons\" \nAs well as Orban's far superior war chest, critics say he has penned biased referendum question and run a menacing, Islamophobic campaign linking migrants with terrorism. \nThis is nothing new. He previously referred to migrants as \"poison\" and \u2014 two months before Donald Trump proposed banning Muslims entering the U.S. \u2014 argued countries needed to \"keep Europe Christian\" by defending their borders from Muslim incomers. \n\"Hungary does not need this kind of intercultural mass migration that is happening at our border,\" government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told The AP last week. \"We don't want those kinds of migrants, for obvious reasons.\" \nVictory would likely be symbolic, however, because the E.U. deal that Orban opposes is already in tatters. A Continent Divided \nThe referendum is the latest flashpoint in a Europe still struggling to come up with a coherent plan for its years-old border crisis . \nFlaring conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere have forced millions to flee their homes. This year alone, more than 300,000 people have attempted the journey across the Mediterranean Sea, some 3,500 dying along the way.

European nations have so far only managed to accept around 3 percent of this target, a figure Amnesty International labeled an \"abject failure.\" \nHungary, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia voted against the proposal from the start. And Sunday's referendum looks set to hammer home their displeasure, not only with an already-defunct system, but the Western liberal consensus on multiculturalism in general. \n\"This referendum is completely symbolic,\" said Robert L. McKenzie, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution . \"This is far more about challenging the authority of the E.U. institution than it is about stopping migrants and refugees.\" \nThe vote is the latest ploy by Orban to cast himself as the antithesis to German leader Angela Merkel, whose relaxed immigration policy saw her accept 1.1 million asylum-seekers last year. \nThe influx has coincided with a rise in far-right nationalism across the continent.

Arturo Conde \nAs the nation celebrates Columbus Day\u2014and others reflect on the negative consequences that this encounter had on indigenous peoples\u2014Yoss said that the story of early Spanish-speaking communities coexisting in the Lower East Side of New York could offer Latinos (and Cubans in his homeland) a lifelong lesson about their mixed heritage. \nDressed in urban combat fatigues and a muscle shirt, Yoss looks like Snake Plissken, the cult antihero from John Carpenter 's classic 1981 movie \" Escape From New York .\" Played by actor Kurt Russell , Plissken is a former special forces soldier turned criminal who enters Manhattan, which has been transformed into a maximum-security prison surrounded by 50-foot containment walls. And Yoss similarly challenges both Cubans and Americans to climb over the political and cultural walls that separate their homes from other places. \nRELATED: Our 'Super Extra Grande' Talk with Cuban Science-Fiction Novelist Yoss \nYoss walked with us around an area rich in history and culture. Squeezed between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges on the Lower East Side, tourists and New Yorkers alike can find the stories of different immigrant communities who lived in close proximity during many generations. \nThis coexistence between Cubans, Spaniards, Jews, Chinese, and other groups, Yoss explained, shows how beneath everyone's differences is a universal immigrant heritage that connects the whole planet. Yoss touring Hispanic and immigrant landmarks New York City. Arturo Conde \n\"Remembering how Cubans were welcomed to New York [with other immigrants] even before the Statue of Liberty existed teaches us an important lesson about coexistence,\" said Yoss. \"To be Cuban, like any other nationality, is a state of mind. And to be an immigrant is much more complex than the religions, flags and languages that divide us. Immigrants have to connect with different people to survive.\" \nRELATED: Through Program, Cuban American Millennials Visit Island for 1st Time \nThe first wave of Cuban immigrants settled in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other parts of New York City in the 1870's and 1880's. These exiles escaped ongoing violence and repression during Cuba's fight for independence from Spain. \nMany Cuban immigrants were Catholic, and migrated north to work in cigar factories opened by other Cubans\u2014and Spanish immigrants \u2014in Key West, Tampa and New York. The most popular immigrant from this community was the legendary poet and independence leader Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed\u2014honored with a statue in Central Park \u2014who worked tirelessly from New York to end slavery in Cuba and recruit supporters for independence. Yoss touring Hispanic and immigrant landmarks New York City.

While more than 1,300 miles separate Cuba from Manhattan, the priest's persecution does not end. Spanish police in Havana dispatch a hit man to murder Varela in the Lower East Side. But loyal Irish parishioners quickly rally to protect the Cuban, driving out el tuerto (the one-eyed) thug from New York before he could carry out the 30,000-peso assassination contract. \nAs the Vicar General of the Diocese of New York, Varela had become an important leader in the Irish Catholic community\u2014even learning Gaelic to better serve the influx of new parishioners. \nRELATED: How A 19th Century Cuban Immigrant Became A Countess And Author \nThis ability to cross over between languages and cultures, Yoss pointed out, is part of the enduring legacy of many immigrants from the Lower East Side, where the roots of early Spanish-speaking communities were planted. \nJust around the corner from St. James Church\u2014 purchased by Varela in 1835 \u2014is the first Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic Jewish cemetery \u2014founded by Jewish immigrants who settled in New Amsterdam in 1654. \nAround the other corner on Madison Street, where the Alfred E.Smith Houses now stand, was Roosevelt Street\u2014the heart of the Spanish immigrant community in the 1910s and 1920s.

In 2003, then-Senator Hillary Clinton voted against the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban, a ban on an abortion procedure known as dilation and extraction that happens later in pregnancy, because it lacked an exception for the woman's health and life.

According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 1.3 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks. And 43 states ban abortion when the fetus is viable, or even earlier , some with exceptions for rape, incest, the health of the mother, or fetal abnormality.

And Clinton has garnered more than $2.4 million worth of PAC and individual contributions from Internet companies, compared to just $31,738 to Trump, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \nBut for those employed by smaller-scale operations in California's technological hub, issues like cybersecurity, foreign policy and immigration have become more urgent than ever before during this presidential cycle. \n\"Cyber is sort of the center of our universe,\" said Andrew Rubin, the founder and CEO of tech security company Illumio. \"There is a massive need to find new and better solutions to our nation's problems. What we are looking for and who we are talking about is that whoever wins this election is going to be walking into a vastly different world than President Obama did.\" \nWith the White House linking the series of election-year cyberattacks to Russia -- and with Wikileaks making scores of government emails public -- learning how to deal with a new type of warfare needs to be a U.S. priority, Rubin said. \n\"The government and private industry are going to have to find ways to work together,\" Rubin said. \"We need to acknowledge that fighting a cyber warfare is fundamentally different than fighting a physical war. A lot of times in cyber, the attackers have a lot of leverage. The leverage is vastly different than in the physical war. I would argue those plans do not exist in a well-formatted way today.\" \nAs information from data breaches become a growing concern for many inside and outside of the national security community, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio who has said he fears that hacks will soon be used by foreign agents as blackmail, Trump and Clinton have both mentioned how they will deal with issues of cybersecurity. \n\"Hillary will support efforts to strengthen cybersecurity, both for government networks and for the private sector,\" reads a statement from Clinton's campaign factsheet on technology and innovation.\" Cybersecurity is essential to our economic and national security, and it will only become increasingly important as more commercial, consumer and government devices are networked.\" \nOn the Trump side, his web team recently added a section outlining how he will deal with cybersecurity. One of his recommendations includes creating a \"Cyber Review Team,\" which would advise federal departments. \nCampaign contributions from Silicon Valley workers is nothing new. After all, President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign saw even more support than Clinton is getting now from this very group. But the reason tech donors are so keen on placing their bets on a presidential outcome may lie in the nature of the job, according to Full Spectrum CEO Stewart Kantor. \n\"It's our responsibility to be thinking 15 to 20 years out,\" said Kantor, whose company works closely with providing private data networks to utility companies. \"So a lot of this innovation is about going forward. My feeling is that we are hearing more about the future and about the modernization of the [electrical] grid from one side.\" \nThough Kantor said Clinton's proposal to build a new electrical grid has resonated with him the most, he admits that the issues his clients grapple with on a daily basis -- solar adoption and renewable energy-- will have to be addressed regardless of which candidate is in office. \n\"There's no way to avoid it,\" Kantor said. \"Whoever wins will have to deal with this issue. You are often going to have to run to plug the phone in. Well, the utility [company] has to think 'How am I going to get the energy in?' We are going to put pressure on the government to have them figure this out. This issue is going to have to be confronted.\" \nFor one Silicon Valley start-up, labor policy was a deciding factor. \n\"Number one issue is immigration,\" said Aye Moah, co-founder of email management company Boomerang and an immigrant from Burma herself. \"There are a lot of highly qualified candidates that we cannot hire because we can't deal with the mess of the situation.\" \nThe H-1B program, which allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers within certain fields, has served as a dividing line between the two campaigns. Clinton often says that the United States should \"staple\" a green card to the diplomas of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) masters and phD recipients. Trump's position has been more unclear; he's given conflicting statements about whether or not he supports the program, although he has generally lamented \"uncontrolled foreign worker admissions.\" \nMoah and her husband, who both work for the company, have already donated $5,400 to the Clinton campaign and attended one of the nominee's San Francisco events last week. \n\"It's really hard to advocate for a candidate that doesn't believe in science and doesn't believe in an economy where everybody have a chance,\" said Moah, referring to Trump. \"In Silicon valley, we believe in the American Dream.

He told volunteers in Michigan then that \"it feels like I got kidnapped.\" Even just last month at an event in Norfolk, Virginia, Kaine marveled at Clinton picking him: \"I felt like Pinocchio turning into a real boy. What, me?\" Play VPs' task: 'Make the candidates look good' 4:35 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/778852419737\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nUp until the moment he was chosen, Kaine was living a largely normal life within the bounds of being a U.S. senator, doing his own errands and showing up to many of his public events by himself in his own car. Since then, his entourage has grown substantially with secret service, more staffers, and a crew of reporters following him everywhere he goes. \nBut the process of melding into the campaign as an effective partner for Clinton has been fairly seamless and Kaine has proven to be a highly reliable messenger for the ticket, echoing the campaign's daily talking points and becoming a smooth-running part of the campaign's tightly controlled machine without the threat of ever going rogue. \nAt Tuesday night's vice presidential debate in Kaine's home state of Virginia, the senator's challenge will be to keep that steady message going. Staying on point \nWhile a few members of Kaine's Senate office moved over to work for him on the campaign, including his former chief of staff and communications director, it is largely people from the Clinton campaign who are in charge of the operation around Kaine now. \nOn a daily basis, the message Kaine is pushing on the campaign trail is in lockstep with the overall Clinton campaign. The week of the NBC News Commander-In-Chief forum, when Clinton was focused on hitting Trump on national security issues, Kaine gave a wide-ranging speech at a historic USO building in Wilmington, North Carolina condemning what he sees as Trump's \"disqualifying\" foreign policy views. \nThe day after Hillary Clinton gave an extensive speech in Reno aiming to tie Trump to the \"alt-right\" corners of the country, Kaine doubled down on her message, telling a crowd the next day at one of Florida's historically black colleges, \"Ku Klux Klan values, David Duke values, Donald Trump values are not American values, they're not our values, and we've got to do all we can to fight to push back and win.\" \nKaine's campaigning and fundraising travels have so far taken him to 35 states - many of them multiple times - and hundreds of people show up to see him at each visit, although in most cases the people coming to see Kaine are already big Clinton supporters or volunteers. The senator spends considerable time after almost every event taking pictures and shaking hands. But unlike his rival Mike Pence, who regularly does town halls where he takes questions from voters, Kaine has never held a \"town hall\" as the vice presidential nominee where he took formal questions from the people who show up to see him. \nAlthough Kaine's campaign stops in swing states rarely end up dominating major national headlines, his visits are geared toward getting local news coverage. Kaine does interviews with local TV stations or publications at almost every market he visits.

You're not going to read about it in the press and you're not going to see it on TV.' The relationship works when you play a supportive role like that if you are extremely candid in person, but you can't surprise folks.\" \nEven though their message and talking points are usually in tandem, Kaine doesn't necessarily talk with Clinton on a daily basis, a fact that became evident when he eventually admitted that he didn't learn of her pneumonia diagnosis until two days later. \n\"We don't talk every day, but in terms of communicating either directly or in a larger group we're communicating, it's -- you know, most, like within a two-day period we're doing something together, talking to each other,\" he told reporters at a press conference in Dayton, Ohio last month, pointing out, \"any time I need to talk to her, I do. And we talk immediately. Sometimes it's one-on-one and sometimes it's part of a larger group.\" \nWhile Pence regularly appears with Trump on the trail - roughly once a week or so - Kaine and Clinton have primarily campaigned separately. They kicked off a 3-day bus tour together across Pennsylvania and Ohio after the Democratic National Convention, and they held a joint rally together on Labor Day in Cleveland, but they have not campaigned together since. Stressing the biography \nOn the campaign trail over the last few months, Kaine has hit all of the major swing states for rallies or public appearances, but many of his stops have been tailor-made to accentuate details of his biography. \nIn a major address to the National Urban League in Baltimore, on August 4th, Kaine spoke in depth about the racial \"scar tissue\" in his home city of Richmond, Virginia - a majority minority city -- highlighting his work as a civil rights lawyer focusing on housing discrimination cases and as a local city councilman and mayor while the city continued to work through racial division. \"Those of us in the majority, we are not forced to learn the ways of anybody else,\" he said that day . \"And we can insulate or wall ourselves off, even without intending to. We have to force ourselves out of our comfort zone to learn about the realities of all the beautiful parts of this wonderful American tapestry.\" \nDays later, Kaine sang along to himself before he spoke to a crowd at the Progressive National Baptist Convention in New Orleans, and spoke at length both about his faith, his long-time, diverse church in Richmond, his civil rights work and thoughts on voting rights and criminal justice reform.

Kaine told stories about his father, Al, who was in attendance, and who ran an ironworking shop near the stockyards of Kansas City, as the campaign tried to appeal to these crowds of mostly white men with technical education training, a group Trump has made inroads with. \nOn one of his single \"days off\" from the trail last month on September 24th, Kaine wanted to pay a visit to the Chickahominy Indian Tribe Fall Festival & Pow Wow in Providence Forge, Virginia, an event he has attended for years with people who have \"enriched\" his life. He told reporters there about his ongoing efforts to get six Virginia tribes federal recognition.

On September 25th, Kaine stopped by Fiesta Mexicana in Atlanta, Georgia, an annual local festival featuring Latin entertainers where Kaine spoke almost entirely in Spanish while greeting people at the festival for more than an hour and speaking on stage about immigration and voting. \nThen the next day on September 26th, Kaine made a stop in Florida that served as a somber reminder of the toughest period of his career. The senator made a quiet, unannounced visit to the site of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando with Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly. Kaine was governor of Virginia during the massacre at Virginia Tech in 2007, and he refers to that day as the worst day of his life. At the Pulse site, Kaine approached the small group of reporters following him with tears in his eyes. \"This is a weird thing to say, but I always hoped that the Virginia Tech one would be the worst one ever,\" he said, appearing to choke up. \"As bad as that was, I hoped that nothing would ever eclipse it but, such as life. We got work to do.\" Very emotional moment as a choked up Kaine visited Pulse shooting site. \"I always hoped that the VA Tech one would be the worst one ever.\" pic.twitter.com/vn5oUovyMp \u2014 Kailani Koenig (@kailanikm) September 26, 2016 The other trail \nWhile Kaine has been traveling almost non-stop since joining Clinton's ticket, he hasn't just been on the campaign trail -- he's spent a considerable time chasing the money trail, attending nearly 80 private fundraisers since the start of August, more than the number of publicly advertised campaign events he has done in the same amount of time. At these private fundraisers, which have all been closed to the public and the press, Kaine has raised money at the homes of celebrities like Eva Longoria, and appeared alongside musical guests like Lindsey Buckingham from Fleetwood Mac, T Bone Burnett, Michael Bolton, and Asleep At The Wheel. \nThe fundraisers have been in all corners of the country with varying degrees of pricing to attend. One of the more pricey appearances was at the Tavern on the Green Restaurant in Central Park in New York City last month, where five people contributed up to $500,000 to attend. \nOne of Kaine's assets as a running mate was always going to be his connections to major donors who he grew to know during his years as chairman of the DNC. On Saturday, the Clinton campaign boasted their strongest fundraising month yet, raising $154 million for Hillary for America & the Democratic Party in September, leaving them with more than $150 million in the bank. \nWhen he was asked on his plane recently about his role in raising massive amount of money while also pushing for campaign finance reform, he told reporters, \"I'm going to keep pushing for reform, but if the other side's going to block reform, and I have to play an away game on their field, I'm going to play an away game on their field.\" Kailani Koenig ", "Oct 4 2016, 8:48 am ET Nevada Race Heats Up with Potential First Latina U.S. Senator by Alexandra Jaffe The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is seen in Las Vegas, Nevada in this file photo taken September 10, 2011. STEVE MARCUS / Reuters Share advertisement \nDemocrats are hoping to make history by electing the first Latina U.S. senator in a hotly-contested race to replace Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid in Nevada. Their prospects may be looking up: Polls have tightened over the past week following some local developments that have complicated the GOP's pitch to minority voters. \nFormer Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto is their candidate, and on paper, she seems ideal: The granddaughter of Mexican and Italian immigrants, she makes personal pitches to first- and second-generation immigrants on the stump. Like many other multi-generation U.S. Hispanics, she does not speak Spanish fluently but can understand it. She has made outreach to Nevada's sizable Latino community a centerpiece of her campaign and touts her support for progressive policies such as a higher minimum wage and immigration reform.

That electoral strength \u2014 Heck's district includes much of Clark County, one of the state's two most populous counties, with a demographic makeup that mirrors Nevada's population \u2014 is part of what's given Republicans high hopes for his chances at a statewide bid. \nHeck has been winning in the polls, and both Republicans and Democrats involved in the race say that's because, despite Cortez Masto's attractive profile, $15.3 million in attack ads from GOP outside groups have helped her opponents.

The Koch brothers fund many conservative causes and have backed the LIBRE Initiative, a group that works in the Latino community for conservative ideals and those who back them. \nBut Democrats point to a trio of bad news developments last week \u2014 adding up to what veteran Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston called Heck's \"Terrible Thursday\" \u2014 as a potential turning point in the race. \nThat day, a GOP operative mistook one African American elected official for another in attempting to attack Cortez Masto and BuzzFeed published a collection of racist and sexist postings Heck's son made on social media; Rep. Heck subsequently apologized . Moreover, two of Heck's former advisers questioned Cortez Masto's Mexican heritage, including one who said the Las Vegas-born Cortez Masto, whose father is from Mexico but who also has Italian roots, \"is about as Mexican as I am.\" Catherine is about as Mexican as I am. It's relevant when applying for scholarhsips...or running for #nvsen https://t.co/18RzjRbDnY \u2014 Tom McAllister (@TMAC702) September 22, 2016 \nHe also asked whether she speaks Spanish, drawing allegations he was questioning whether she was truly Latina based on her language skills. \u2014 Tom McAllister (@TMAC702) September 22, 2016 \nAnother former Heck adviser, Mark Ciavola, said of her references to her heritage as \"Hispandering at its finest,\" in a Facebook comment, according to The Las Vegas Sun. Ralston speculated this could drive Latino turnout against Heck, likening it to Trump's attacks on a Mexican-American judge overseeing a lawsuit against him, which even some Republicans decried as racist. Cortez Masto's campaign said the developments were \"huge news,\" and while they won't be airing any ads pushing the issue, they expect them to be a long-term problem for Heck. \nAt a recent press conference, Cortez Masto didn't mince words in hammering Heck for his former aides' comments. \n\"For long-time aides of Congressman Heck to attack my Mexican heritage, claiming that it is only useful for a college application is disgusting,\" Cortez Masto said. \"Joe Heck does not stand for Nevadan values and we cannot afford to have him in office.\" \nAnd a new survey conducted by Bendixen Amandi International for the Las Vegas Review-Journal shows just a narrow, two-point lead for Heck, 47 percent to 45 percent for Cortez Masto \u2014 making the two statistically tied in the race. \nRELATED: Koch-Backed Group Spends Millions in Ohio, Nevada Races \nPrior to the \"Terrible Thursday\" developments, however, some Democrats in the state said they were concerned about Heck's lead in the polls. \nYvanna Cancela, political director of the state's powerful Culinary Union, which has endorsed Cortez Masto, , described those polls as \"unnerving, especially in what is definitely going to be a very close race.\" \nCancela said she was particularly concerned that Cortez Masto's lack of name recognition may leave some Latino votes on the table. \n\"There's still a lot of getting to know the candidates that needs to happen,\" she said, pointing to a mid-September Univision News poll that showed 38 percent of Nevada Hispanics aren't familiar enough with Cortez Masto to have an opinion on her; 41 percent said the same of Heck. \nAmong Latinos who did know the candidates, however, Cortez Masto led 58 percent to Heck's 24 percent. \nBut Cancela said that GOP messaging in particular is dampening Latino enthusiasm for the election, a trend that, if it continues, could spell trouble for Democrats up and down the ballot on Election Day. \n\"To say the level of [Latino] excitement is going to reach what it did in 2008 or even 2012 is not fair, because the political climate that Trump & the Republican Party have created doesn't allow for it,\" she said. \nNevada remains one of the GOP's top pickup opportunities, and they're not ceding anything to Democrats \u2014 including the Latino vote. Heck's campaign is targeting them with Spanish-language ads, and a number of Koch-backed groups are also actively working to win over Latinos and turn them out to the polls in November.

But things have not turned out as planned. \nAfghanistan remains one of the world's poorest and most corrupt nations. The Taliban controls more territory than at any time since it was unseated and the civilian death toll in the violence has hit record highs . Malalai Joya in 2009. Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star via Getty Images \nJoya is a veteran anti-warlord campaigner who believes the government is embracing precisely the people who helped bring Afghanistan to its knees after the Soviet Union occupation ended in 1989. \nShe cited the September peace deal with \"The Butcher of Kabul\" Gulbuddin Hekmatyar \u2014 a fundamentalist warlord infamous for his savagery even in a country all too used to brutality. \nThe agreement was a betrayal and \"signals more horror and bloodshed,\" she told NBC News from Kabul, where she lives in hiding. \"Gulbuddin is a devious rascal that has always brought sorrow and bloodshed, and it cannot be that he has become an angel of peace and kindness toward the end of his life.\" \nHekmatyar got significant aid from the U.S. to fight the Soviets, but is accused of killing or wounding thousands when his troops fired on Kabul during the civil wars of the 1990s. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar appears on a screen during a signing ceremony at the presidential palace in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Sept. 29. Rahmat Gul / AP \nAnd despite his later inclusion on the State Department's Specially Designated Global Terrorist list, Secretary of State John Kerry called September's deal a \"model\" for a possible pact with the Taliban. Sayed Ahmad Gilani, head of the Afghan government's High Peace Council, hailed it as \"the beginning of a permanent peace in our country.\" \nJoya rejects this, saying the \"disastrous\" pact was being praised by people \"who have no idea.\" \nThe native of Farah Province has spent much of her life battling the influence of fighters like Hekmatyar, as well as Vice President Rashid Dostum and Second Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq have also faced accusations of rights abuses. \nThe United States has \"replaced the barbaric regime of the fundamentalist Taliban with the fundamentalist terrorist warlords who have bloody hands,\" Joya said. \"The consequences of this 15 years of occupation was more bloodshed, more human rights violations and women's rights violations, more massacres. In fact, the terrorists are empowered.\" \nHer campaign made her a celebrity in Afghanistan and propelled her into parliament in 2005. But it has also put her in grave danger and she says she has faced numerous attempts on her life. \nLike millions of fellow Afghans, Joya allowed herself to hope the 2001 invasion would help rid her country of warlords who had ravaged her country, paved the way for the Taliban to take over in 1996 and driven millions into exile. \n\"Many warlords were brought into government, where they continued their abuses, maintained private militias, and had links to narcotics, smuggling and criminal networks.\" \nBut the militia leaders' influence lives on and has seriously hindered Afghanistan's development, according to Joya and others. \nThe Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) , a U.S. government watchdog, last month criticized America's alliances with warlords and said many of them \"committed war crimes and grave human rights abuses against fellow Afghans.\" \n\"Many warlords were brought into government, where they continued their abuses, maintained private militias, and had links to narcotics, smuggling and criminal networks,\" according to SIGAR's list of lessons learned from the U.S. invasion. \"U.S. partnerships with such individuals gave the Afghan population the impression the United States tolerated corruption and other abuses, seriously undercutting U.S. credibility.\" \nJoya, who was a teenager living in a refugee camp in Pakistan in 2001, was among the millions of refugees who returned to rebuild their lives and their country. \nIn 2003, she electrified her countrymen and women when she stood up at the country's Loya Jirga \u2014 a meeting of notables convened to help lay the groundwork for the new, post-Taliban Afghanistan. \nShe shouted up to the chairman presiding the meeting \u2014 which in itself was extraordinary. A woman's voice heard in a public space is a rare thing nowadays in Afghanistan but in the days immediately following the Taliban's ouster it was practically unheard of. \n\"Why would you allow criminals to be present at this Loya Jirga? Warlords are responsible for our country's situation,\" she said as some of the members clapped and other remained stony faced \u2014 her outburst clearly caused grave offense. \n\"They oppress women and have ruined our country. They should be prosecuted. They might be forgiven by the Afghan people, but not by history.\" \nThe meeting erupted in jeers and shouting. Her criticism of the militiamen, many of whom fought the Soviet invasion and then turned on each other with little regard to civilian suffering, was considered so offensive that she was thrown out. \nClearly Joya's criticism resonated and she went on to win a seat in parliament a few years later \u2014 from where she was suspended after she compared parliament to an animal stable. \nBut Joya's words in 2003 were prophetic. With violence on the rise and the Taliban apparently on the ascendant, she places the blame on the U.S. and its allies \n\"The consequences of this 15 years of occupation was more bloodshed, more human rights violations and women's rights violations, more massacres.

LGBT rights \u2014 The issue bubbled up consistently during the primaries (Ted Cruz bet big on bathroom paranoia) and has become a major national issue in aftermath of states like North Carolina passing bills that many believe infringe on the civil liberties of LGBT people. But it never made its way to the debate stage, which was especially surprising during the VP debate, since GOP nominee Mike Pence signed one of the first so-called \"religious freedom\" bills as governor of Indiana.\nLGBT rights is one of the few areas where Trump actually seems to be on the left of Republican party orthodoxy. He's said in the past that Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, should be able to use the bathroom of her choice. On the other hand, he has said he opposes same-sex marriage. Clinton, who opposed same-sex marriage during the 2008 election, has evolved on that issue. For some, LGBT equality is the civil rights issue of our time, so for it to get no mention during the 2016 debates would be a huge oversight.\nPlay Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Trump Calls For Drug Test Ahead of Third, Final Debate 0:42 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog 3. Drugs \u2014 Although Donald Trump is keen to have his opponent drug tested, his actually position on both the waning 'war on drugs' and efforts to legalize both medicinal and recreation marijuana is murky at best. This year several states \u2014 including California, Nevada, Florida and Maine \u2014 are going to have drug reform laws on the ballot, which could either minimize penalties for possession or legalize medicinal use. Where do the candidates stand on this issue? It hasn't been discussed. Considering how much attention was paid to the heroin epidemic in states like New Hampshire, the candidates haven't been asked about their plans to combat addiction or crack down on the illegal drug trade.\n\"It's concerning to me that cannabis legalization hasn't received much attention during this election cycle. Six states have full adult-use legalization on the ballot, yet what do the candidates have to say?\" Kyle Sherman, co-founder and CEO of Flowhub , told NBC News. \"There is an obvious surge in public concern around the issue, yet this election cycle has seen much less coverage on the topic than others in the past. The questions are certainly there, there just hasn't been enough discussion on the issue to see anything remotely close to an answer.\"\n4. Medicare and Social Security \u2014 There is a great deal of anxiety about solvency and future of the two most popular so-called entitlement programs, particularly among the generation of Americans poised to enter into the system. Both Trump and Clinton have pledged to leave Social Security and Medicare untouched as president, but neither was pressed during the first two debates about how they would make sure each program remains solvent. Curiously, this was yet another topic that was addressed in the VP debate, where Democrat Tim Kaine pointed out that Trump had compared Social Security in the past to a \"Ponzi scheme,\" while Republican Mike Pence stated that his ticket would \"meet the obligations\" of both programs.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton makes a point during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri on Oct. 9, 2016. PAUL J. RICHARDS / AFP - Getty Images 5. Reproductive Rights \u2014 Although Hillary Clinton did say she wanted to appoint a Supreme Court justice who would preserve Roe v. Wade , there hasn't been a deep dive into one of the most divisive social issues in America. Donald Trump's controversial assertion \u2014 later retracted \u2014 that women should be \"punished\" if they get an abortion was only revisited in the VP debate when Pence insisted that neither he nor his running mate would support legislation that punished women. Kaine, who is personally opposed to the procedure, asked rhetorically: \"Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\"\n6. Sexual Assault (on Colleges Campuses and in the Military) \u2014 To the shock of many voters, allegations of sexual assault levied at Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, have sucked much of the oxygen out of presidential debates so far. But there has been no discussion about the epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses or the outbreak of sexual violence in the military.\nRelated: Hillary Clinton to Spend 5 Days Preparing for Las Vegas Debate\nTrump has tweeted that \"no one\" has more respect for women than he does, and has linked incidents of sexual assault in the military to the fact that men and women serve together. When pressed on this controversial position at NBC's Commander-in-Chief Forum last month, he doubled down . Both candidates should probably make plain their positions on women in combat, including whether or not they can or should serve alongside men, and also how they intend to address threats and violence directed towards women in environments where the public presumes a reasonable degree of safety and security, like our institutions of higher education.\nPlay Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed Are colleges equipped to handle sexual assault allegations? 7:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog 7. College Affordability \u2014 Speaking of higher educatoin, although Trump has recently rolled out a 'plan' to reduce college debt and Clinton has named-checked her proposal for \"debt-free\" college in the first debate, the substance of how to really tackle this problem has been completely overlooked so far \u2014 which may be detrimental to Democrats who are hoping to capitalize on their historic advantages with younger voters, and hoping to motivate them to the polls with a focus on this, one of their biggest concerns.\n8. Campaign Finance Reform \u2014 With his largely self-funded primary campaign, Donald Trump (alongside Democrat Bernie Sanders, who differentiated himself by refusing corporate donations) helped put campaign finance reform back in the center of political debates.\nAlthough Trump has criticized the controversial Citizens United case in the past, which allowed corporations to make unlimited donations to Super PACs, he has since hired David Bossie , former president of Citizens United, as his deputy campaign manager. This raises questions about his commitment to overhauling a system he has referred to as \"rigged.\"\nMeanwhile, Clinton did say in the second debate that she would seek to appoint Supreme Court justices that would overturn the ruling, but she has yet to outline how else she would or could pursue reform should that option not present itself.\nPlay Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed The voting wars 8:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog 9. Voting Rights \u2014 In the second debate, on the same answer regarding the Supreme Court, Clinton said she would appoint a justice who recognized \"voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country.\" But she didn't speak specifically to the gutting of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2014, which many critics believe could open up the floodgates for more voter suppression.\nTrump, a big proponent of voter ID laws, has made the credibility of the vote a major talking point on the campaign trail this week, so this topic will likely be raised on Wednesday, albeit with regards to potential cheating and fraud, as opposed to access.\n10. Gun Control \u2014 Many viewers found it ironic that although the second presidential debate took place in St. Louis, not far from Ferguson , where the death of Michael Brown galvanized the Black Lives Matter movement, that gun violence hasn't been a bigger factor in the early clashes between Trump and Clinton.\nThe two candidates have discussed their different policies when it comes to policing and addressing racial tensions with law enforcement, but neither has been pressed as to what, if anything, can be done about mass shootings or about guns falling into the hands of unstable people. As concerns about potential post-election violence have spiked in the aftermath of a firebombing of a Trump campaign office in North Carolina, it will be curious to see if either candidate talks about strategic solutions on Wednesday.", "As long as Donald Trump can call People vile names, be Racists, and Defile Women, with his Twitter Finger of Doom, that is OK, but when he falls on his own INEPTNESS, and others Push Back with PROOF, THEN HE BECOMES A WHINNING LITTLE BEEOTCH. \\n\nThe System is Rigged.

Jonathan Ernst / Reuters \nSergeant Jessica Hawkins was a male cop for 20 years but it was not until her transition to a woman in 2014 that she understood the trepidation that transgender women feel across the United States. \n\"Transitioning has made me understand the fears of other communities that I did not have as white male,\" said Hawkins, 43, noting a difference in the way she is treated when off duty and away from her relatively tolerant city of Washington. \n\"I don't feel as safe as I used to. It was never an issue before.\" \nHawkins became head of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) liaison unit a year after her transition, at a time when transgender women, especially blacks and Latinas, are being assaulted and murdered at an alarming rate in America. \nAt least 22 transgender people have been killed so far this year, matching the previous recorded high in all of 2015, according to the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP). Eighteen of those killed this year have been black or Latina, up from 13 in all of last year. Sergeant Hawkins displays information about unsolved murders of LGBT victims at her office in Washington on October 10, 2016. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters \nOf the 22 killings in 2015, the NCAVP classified 18 as hate crimes. \nTransgender people have a name for the uneasiness they feel when they are in public, facing dirty looks, hateful insults from strangers, and a perceived presumption of guilt from police. It's called \"walking while trans,\" and it is particularly dangerous for minority transgender women. \n\"We are in a state of emergency because of the continuous attacks and murder of our community,\" said Bamby Salcedo, president of the TransLatin@ Coalition, an organization that advocates for transgender immigrants. \nTransgender rights have burst into U.S. awareness the past two years, extending the conflict between conservative and liberal values in America. \nUnder President Barack Obama, the U.S. government has issued regulations aimed at providing equal protection under the law, while state Republican officials, notably in Texas and North Carolina, have resisted in the courts, citing traditional values and accusing the federal government of overreach. \nIn the meantime, the death toll for black and Latina transgender women has climbed. Washington Metropolitan Police Department Sergeant Jessica Hawkins, a transgender woman who leads the department's LGBT unit, displays information about unsolved murders of LGBT victims at her office in Washington on October 10, 2016. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters \nOn Oct. 8 in Cleveland, a black transgender woman named Brandi Bledsoe, 32, was found dead behind a home with plastic bags over her head and hands and a gunshot wound to the chest. \nLast month, a black trans woman named T.T. Saffore, 28, was found dead with multiple stab wounds to the neck, chest, back and hands in Chicago's Garfield Park. \nA few days later, a black trans woman named Crystal Edmonds, 32, was shot dead in the back of the head on a street in northwest Baltimore. \nPolice have reported no arrests in those three cases. TRANS WOMAN AND COP Washington Metropolitan Police Department Sergeant Jessica Hawkins (C), a transgender woman who leads the department's LGBT unit, speaks with transgender activist Ruby Corado (L) at a home in Washington on October 10, 2016, where Corado shelters transgender women of color. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters \nWashington has taken a distinct approach by appointing Hawkins as what may be the only transgender cop to head an LGBT unit in the country. Hawkins knows of a handful of transgender officers elsewhere in the country through private, online networks, but believes she is the only LGBT liaison. \nShe has set out to meet every transgender person at risk of hate violence in the capital but says the dangers are greater for transgender people in the southern towns where she used to work as a cop. \n\"I'm head of the LGBT unit and I'm scared of law enforcement in other parts of the country,\" said Hawkins, who nonetheless enjoys violating North Carolina law by using public restrooms for women when she visits relatives there. \nActivists such as those at the NCAVP coalition, which tracks homicide cases in the media, say that for black or Latina transgender women, walking while trans is even more likely to get them killed. Gaby Milena Rivera poses for a portrait in New York City on September 27, 2016. Brendan McDermid / Reuters \nGaby Milena Rivera, 28, a Guatemalan immigrant living in the New York borough of Queens, was one of those to survive. In August she was hit in the head with a hammer by a man who yelled, \"This is what happens for being gay\" before striking. \nShe says she woke up in the hospital. \nShe is resentful that she cannot walk the streets alone without looking over her shoulder. \n\"Even when we're just going to the store, a lot people stare at us,\" Milena Rivera said. \"We have the right to go to the store. I don't know why they look at us that way. We're all human beings. We deserve respect, too.\" Gaby Milena Rivera (L) speaks with a friend in New York City on September 27, 2016. Brendan McDermid / Reuters \nThere are no official figures to track murders and assaults on transgender people, likely resulting in an undercount of cases. Advocates say police often misrepresent the gender of victims in reports and often presume the transgender victims or witnesses are the perpetrators when they arrive at the scene, creating a climate of mistrust. \nThe anti-violence coalition found less than half of LGBT victims of hate violence report their cases to police, and of the those who did 80 percent said police were indifferent or hostile. \nPolice need to incorporate transgender relations into their academies and on-the-job training, said Lieutenant Nicholas Augustine of Maryland's Montgomery County Police Department. \nAugustine said transgender Latinas in Montgomery County told him police kept profiling them as prostitutes, but none had filed a formal complaint. \n\"We need transgender people to be part of our training, so officers are not meeting a transgender person for the first time on the job and stuttering over their words, not knowing whether to call the person sir or ma'am,\" he said. HATE CRIMES UNDERREPORTED \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation reported zero hate crime homicides against transgender people in 2014, the latest year of available data, when the anti-violence coalition reported at least 11 black or Latina transgender women were killed. \nAn FBI spokesman said the bureau has increased the number of hate crimes investigations to include such cases, but without quantifying them. \n\"Cases related to gender identity bias are difficult to identify. It is not always apparent a crime was motivated by the victim's gender and these crimes tend to be underreported,\" FBI spokesman Christopher Allen said in a statement. \nThe walls and shelves of Hawkins' office just off Washington's Dupont Circle are covered with awards for the unit's work, but one hallway also bears reminders of unsolved murders. Fliers advertise $25,000 rewards for information leading to the arrest and conviction of six cold cases, all involving black transgender women, from 2000 to 2011.

Now, as both trans woman and cop, she says those two worlds often collide. \n\"I do see a lot of hate crimes and it does weigh on my personal life when I see bad things happen to transgender people.\" \nFollow NBC OUT on Twitter , Facebook and Instagram .

What's more, the young immigrant has created technology that helps U.S. families as well as their relatives in their home countries. \nAt the recent Money 20/20 Conference in Las Vegas, Regalii CEO Edrizio De La Cruz unveiled his company's new platform, designed to make bill payments more profitable for banks while improving the overall experience for customers. This is building on what the company initially developed \u2014 an app that makes it easier for immigrants to send money home to friends and family. \nDe La Cruz, 35, co-founded Regalii - the name is a play on the Spanish word regalo, which means gift. He started the firm with his partners in 2012, after he graduated from the prestigious Wharton School of Business. Their initial product was an app that consumers could use to send money to family members in other countries from their mobile devices. \nRELATED: Regalii: Dominican Entrepreneur's Novel Way to Send Remittances \n\"What led to starting the company was my own experiences as an immigrant,\" said De La Cruz. \"My family here would send money back to the Dominican Republic to my aunt and my grandma but it was a very tedious, time-consuming process on both ends.\" \nBack then, De La Cruz explained, anyone sending remittances would have to go to a storefront business or a company like Western Union, and the recipient would have to do the same - and then go to their bank to deposit the funds or to stores to pay their bills.

More Latinos Needed in Tech Industry \nDe La Cruz notes that he is concerned about the overall lack of Latinos in the tech industry. \"This is something that I am very passionate about. I google 'Latino tech entrepreneurs\" and not much comes up,\" he said. \"Latinos are very under-represented in the tech fields, due to a variety of cultural, educational and structural factors. One of my motivations to be successful is to make it easier for the next Latino coming up.\" \nThe lack of Latinos in the high tech fields is well documented, and has been reported by multiple outlets , including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.

A smaller percentage of these Latinos are in senior or leadership roles. \nRELATED: Digital Divide Is Narrowing for Latinos: Report \nRon Gonzales, President and CEO of the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley , points out that even these numbers are something of an overstatement. \"These figures include all technology company workers, including those who might work in administration or marketing or sales,\"he said. \"So our guesstimate is there are probably one percent of Latinos in high tech companies actually working with technology.\" \nAsked about the low numbers of Latinos in the technology industry, Gonzales said, \"Some people, both inside and outside the industry, believe it is a pipeline issue. Others believe it is an interview process issue. I personally believe it is a little bit of both.\" CEO of Regalii Emmanuel Abreu \nThe technology industry, Gonzales said, has to do a better job of recruiting as well as retaining and engaging Latino workers. He says the industry is still in what he termed the \"discovery\" phase, where they are recognizing their lack of diversity. \"But they have not moved on to the second phase of figuring out how to correct the issue.\" \nRegalii's team of financial and technology experts is highly diverse. Still, De La Cruz said he understood, in part, why the lack of diversity persisted in the tech industry. \n\"Most Latinos do not come from an affluent background. When you grow up in the Heights, The Bronx, East L.A., the ecosystem is not there for you to succeed at this level in the tech field,\" he stated. \"The people who go out and raise money for tech, they have been primed for that; they have been surrounded by that environment.\" \nRELATED: 'Latina Girls Code' Trains, Empowers Young Women for Tech Careers \nAlthough De La Cruz has found his way into a challenging field, he faced stereotypical expectations along the way. \"When people who don't interact with our communities think of Latinos or Dominicans, they think of baseball players. I know that I look different from most the people across the table from me,\" he said. \"So I have to be ten times prepared, ten times better than the next person. The first thing I say has to be very eloquent, to shift the perception right away.\" \nDe La Cruz is part of an often under-reported trend: the growing impact of successful Latino small business owners. Research from the Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative (SLEI) shows that Latino-owned small businesses have a significant effect on the U.S. economy. SLEI's State of Latino Entrepreneurship 2015 report found that between 2007 and 2012, the number of Latino-owned businesses grew by 46.9 percent compared to 0.7 percent for non-Latino owned businesses. This suggests that Latinos play an important role in local job creation and economic development. \nBut many of these companies often remain small, due to lack of access to capital. SLEI found that for 70 percent of Latino entrepreneurs, the most common source of funding was personal savings, followed by credit cards and personal bank loans. A separate 2015 study, reported by Forbes , similarly found that Latino small business owners faced hurdles in securing funding . \nRELATED: Young Latino Entrepreneur's Invention Boosts Access to Clean Water \nBy contrast, Regalii is funded by Andreessen Horowitz , Kapor Capital , Initialized Capital, and other leading technology investors. De La Cruz said that Regalii grew by 300 percent last year, and that the company is putting all profits towards continued growth. \n\"When we first invested in Regalii, we saw the opportunity to back a startup that saw around corners in the global market that other could not see,\" said Mitch Kapor of Kapor Capital in a statement. \"Perhaps it took an immigrant to see an opportunity to not only serve other immigrants, but all people who are being underserved in a very large market.\" \nLooking ahead, De La Cruz is focused on growing the company and providing opportunities to a new generation of Latino entrepreneurs. \"I tell younger people that it is important to surround yourself with a small group that you consider your masterminds, people you strive to be like,\" he said. \"You need feedback; I've learned in my lifetime that it is so hard to go it alone.\" \n\"And most of all, you need to give back. If you help others, others will help you,\" De La Cruz added. \"Help for the sake of helping, and it will come back to you in another form.\" \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Think of that,\" Trump said last night in New Mexico. \"That's what could happen. You triple the size of our country in one week.\" \nThis is a baseless claim, so much so that it's hard to pick out an accurate portion of Clinton's policy platform to correct it with. But here's a start: Clinton has called for comprehensive immigration reform and for the resettling for 10,000-60,000 Syrian refugees. She would offer a pathway to citizenship to many of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants already living in the country, and she vows to strengthen American borders. She has not called for open borders or tripling the nation's size. \nIt's also unclear clear where Trump believes all these people would come from; there aren't that many people in Mexico, Canada, or even all of South America. 2 days ago Fact Checking Everything Trump and Clinton Said About the FBI's Email Review \nDonald Trump championed the news that the FBI is reviewing additional emails \"pertinent\" to previous investigations into Hillary Clinton's private email server as a game changer on Friday. But much of Trump's rhetoric about the Clinton emails is riddled with errors, while the Democratic nominee herself obscured how the news of the additional email review was released. \nWe fact checked everything both candidates said on Friday, and will continue doing so. 3 days ago 18 Falsehoods Just From Trump's Thursday Night \nFrom extreme Obamacare tax hikes to allegations of widespread corruption by Hillary Clinton and her allies, Donald Trump's Thursday night offered up 18 inaccuracies \u2014 an impressive feat even for a campaign that has spawned an cottage industry of fact checkers. 4 days ago Trump is Presented With Facts About Recent Hacks \u2014 Ignores Them \nGood Morning America's George Stephanopoulos fact checked Donald Trump in real time Thursday morning over connections between Russia and hacks of Democratic operatives. Despite evidence that both parties have been briefed by U.S. officials about the Russian government's attempts to interfere with the 2016 election, Trump largely ignored him. Take a read. \nABC: All 17 U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Russians are behind that leak, why don't you believe it? \nTrump: I don't know if they're behind it and I think it's a public relations frankly. You know what does bother me? I have nothing\u2014 \nABC: But you were even told that by the Republican head of the homeland security committee, Mike McCaul. He said the same thing. \nTrump: I don't know what he said. \nABC: He told you that he thought the Russians were behind it. \nTrump: Hacking is very interesting. Hacking is very hard to determine who did what, okay. You know that. People are hacking all over the place, nobody knows. They don't know if it's Russia. They can't guarantee it's Russia and it may be. 5 days ago Clinton Slams Trump Hotel, Assuming Intent Along the Way \n\"If you have friends who are thinking of voting for Trump, I want you to tell them that he relied on undocumented workers to make his project cheaper, and most of the products in the rooms were made overseas, and he even sued to get his taxes lowered. But we know he's used undocumented workers, and that's one of the things that he has run his campaign on, about deporting undocumented workers. Well, he's used undocumented. He's made his products in foreign countries. He's used Chinese steel instead of American steel. So, you know, you can talk a good game but let's look at the facts, and the facts show he has stiffed American workers, he has stiffed American businesses,\" Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday while criticizing her rival for attending the ribbon-cutting at his new luxury hotel in Washington, D.C. \nThere's no evidence that Trump purposefully hired undocumented workers to make his project cheaper, though there is evidence that some workers are indeed undocumented. We also don't know whether \"most\" of the products in the rooms were made overseas, though American Bridge, a Democratic super PAC, does appear to have photos showing that many of the products were made elsewhere . \nThe rest of her statement, however, is true. 6 days ago Trump's Assessment of the Race Isn't Accurate \nTo hear Trump tell it, the presidential race is going great: he's winning everything, he'll likely be elected in just two short weeks. But based on the polls and facts at hand, that's just not right. \nHere's what he got right, and wrong, on the state of the race from Tuesday's Florida race. \n\"We're going to have a great victory. We're leading Iowa, we're leading Ohio, we're doing great in north Carolina, Pennsylvania we're going to a lot, I think we're going to do great there.\" \nUnlikely, true, true, false, and unlikely. Trump is polling poorly nationally, and his chances at winning in two weeks are slim. He is leading on average in Iowa and Ohio, but he's trailing by an average of two points in North Carolina and an average of nearly six points in Pennsylvania. \n\"Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track. Every poll says it. We are going to fix it.\" \nThe polls don't say that: on average, 64 percent \u2014 not 75 percent \u2014 of people say the country is on the wrong track. \n\"There's going to be a lot of Brexit in two weeks.\" \nNope, and we already explained why here. 6 days ago Trump Unloads on 'Scum' Fact Checkers. We Checked That Claim Too \n\"Even the so-called fact checkers, who are crooked as hell themselves, they'll check facts with me, and I'll be like 99 percent right, and they'll say therefore he lied! These people are bad\u2026.What a group of dishonest scum we have, I'm telling you,\" Trump said on Tuesday. \nWhile our moms would surely like to dispute the contention that we're \"scum\" and \"crooked as hell,\" let's focus instead on his claim that fact checkers exaggerate small errors. \nThis blog primarily focuses on large whoppers, and makes it clear when Trump's claims are rooted in fact. As this blog is just six weeks old, let's also take a look at the most comprehensive listing of Trump fact checks catalogued by our friends at PolitiFact. They have found 150 claims with significant inaccuracies earning them a \"false\" or \"pants on fire\" ruling. Just 78 claims earned the \"mostly true\" or \"half true\" rating that Trump might argue were an exaggeration. \nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton actually gets a lot more \"mostly true\" or \"half true\" claims\": half of her claims, 140, are rated as that. (Just 35 are \"false\" or \"pants on fire.\") \nBy the numbers, the fact checkers are focusing on Trump's biggest lies -- not exaggerating tiny errors.

But it also opened the Democratic nominee's campaign up for criticism for airing political ads during what could be a deadly storm. \n\"Earlier in the week we made changes to our TV ad reservations across hundreds of stations in several battleground states including Florida,\" Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said. \"Less than 1 percent of those changes included the Weather Channel. We have requested that stations in Florida delay any of those ads on the Weather Channel until after the storm passes.\" \nThe campaign also has added Weather Channel-specific buys in Pennsylvania ($27,000) and New Hampshire ($18,000) during this same timeframe, according to ad-tracking data.

Former GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina has been prepping for a run at the post, according to reports. \nAfter Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 presidential election, the GOP conducted an \"autopsy\" of the party and concluded its survival hinged, in part, on drawing in more Latinos.

He called a federal judge born in the U.S. a Mexican and questioned his ability to be fair in presiding over a lawsuit against Trump. \nAs a result, a number of Hispanics in the GOP have refused to back Trump. Even if he wins, Monty said, \"we are not going to let up\" on the biggest impediment to drawing Hispanics to the party, immigration.

Once again there was little discussion on student debt, our immigration problem, on economic policies beyond the tax codes readily available to the upper strata of society. Donald Trump was incoherent during much of the debate when he tried to talk about anything of substance, talking about a different policy on Syria than his vice presidential candidate. He even seemed sedated at times. Clinton's strategy seems to be to allow Trump to speak as much as possible when he loses control. Rather than engaging Trump, she seems to have calculated, correctly I believe, that Trump's greatest weakness is Donald Trump. \nLike each performance Trump has been a part of in this campaign, whatever value the Trump folks think they gained from this moment will rapidly deteriorate in the phalanx of news rooms now adept at picking his lies apart by placing them side by side with the almost endless film on Trump saying the exact opposite of his many false assertions and accusations.

Trump Spoke to Base, Clinton to Independents Victoria Defrancesco Soto \nThe Presidential candidates weren't just speaking past each other at the second presidential debate, they were speaking to completely different audiences. \nDonald Trump had his base as his sole target and he hit the bull's eye. There was no effort by Trump to win over undecided voters or even establishment Republicans. \nIn contrast, Hillary Clinton was seeking to lock in undecided voters as well as reel in establishment Republicans that have abandoned Trump either in the last 48 hours or earlier. Each candidate won their respective audience hands down. \nOver 13 million voters supported Trump in the primary elections. For the most part these are individuals who have a deep dislike and distrust of Hillary Clinton and like Donald Trump's street fighter style. He danced with the one that brought him. \nTrump began the debate by deflecting on the sexually lewd tape of him by turning to accusations of sexual misconduct of former President Bill Clinton. Trump then gave way to personal attacks on Hillary Clinton. Throughout the debate Trump would say \"she lies\" which is minor compared to him stating early on that Clinton should be sent to jail. And just to get under Clinton's skin, Trump threw in a remark about him seeing evidence that First Lady Michelle Obama has not said nice things about her. \nDonald Trump did not pull any punches. But then again we knew that was going to be the case before the debate when Trump hosted a Facebook Live panel with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault. \nAnd in terms of policy (or the few policy questions that were snuck in) Trump remained elusive on details and stuck to common talking points. \nHillary Clinton desperately wanted to appeal to the ever-shrinking base of Independents through both her substance and style. The style portion of it was the hardest given that she was visibly upset at various points in the debate and struggled to keep her cool. However in the end she did keep it together and then pivoted to detailed policy propositions such as on healthcare, taxes, and the situation in Syria. \nTwice Hillary Clinton highlighted her 30-year career, highlighting the work she has done with various groups - children, the disabled, Latinos, etc. She wanted to make sure the voting (hiring) public knows that she has the professional experience. She also threw in her ability to work across the aisle and touted her relationship with President George W. Bush after 9/11 - a little catnip for anti-Trump Republicans looking for a home. \nIt wasn't pretty, but Trump did what he needed to do as did Clinton. To say that either presidential candidate won outright would be comparing apples to oranges. But, in the end, this debate wasn't about a \"general\" American public but rather very specific sub-segments of them. \nVictoria Defrancesco Soto is a contributor to MSNBC and NBCNews.com, as well as a regular political analyst for Telemundo. Trump Failed the Essential Test of Tonight's Debate Raul Reyes John Makely / NBC News \nLatinos had clear reasons to tune into Sunday's presidential town hall with interest. Like other Americans, we wanted to see whether Donald Trump could manage any semblance of damage control for his recently-revealed lewd comments. Also, consider that Latinos have managed to figure prominently in the post-debate conversations. Remember Alicia Machado , and \"That Mexican thing?\" \nUnfortunately, this debate disappointed on several levels. Latino voters cite the economy, health care, and education as their top priorities. But only health care merited substantive discussion, as Clinton reminded viewers of the ways in which she believes the Affordable Care Act has worked, while Trump simply promised \"great coverage\" for everyone. And once again, there was no discussion of immigration reform. \nClinton stayed wisely on message with her mentions of everyone with whom Trump has feuded, from Judge Gonzalo Curiel to the Khan family, and she ably articulated various policy positions. \nYet it must have been frustrating for her to \"debate\" someone with so little command of the issues. Trump went so far as to threaten to have Clinton jailed if he were elected president, which indicates a fundamental lack of understanding about our judicial system (it's illegal to use the law to go after your political opponents). In addition, he falsely stated that, for minorities, the education system is \"a disaster\" and \"jobs are essentially nonexistent,\" two points that are contradicted by data . \nIn what can only be seen as another reason for Latinos not to vote for him, Trump stated that he would like to see a Supreme Court justice like Antonin Scalia - a justice who consistently voted against civil rights , affirmative action, and voting rights. Noted. \nThe big question of the night was whether Trump would make a full apology for his lewd comments. His defense that it was all \"locker room talk,\" along with his pivot to past allegations against Bill Clinton, were ineffective. \nNoting less than a full apology was called for, and he did not offer one. On these grounds alone, he failed the essential test of the evening. \nOn a personal note: As someone who has been involved with sports and athletics my entire adult life, I would like to point out that men do not speak that way in locker rooms. Occasionally, boys may. Men do not. \nRaul Reyes is an NBC Latino contributor, attorney, journalist and TV commentator. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Stephen A.

An artist's rendering of the ExoMars 2016 Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), with its thrusters firing, beginning its entry into Mars orbit. European Space Agency via EPA \nExoMars 2016's lander, called Schiaparelli, hit the Martian atmosphere as expected at 10:42 a.m. EDT (1442 GMT); however, mission team members are still waiting for a signal to confirm that the craft survived its touchdown six minutes later. \nSchiaparelli's signal came in loud and clear as the lander streaked through the Martian atmosphere but stopped shortly before the lander was scheduled to hit the ground, said Paolo Ferri, head of ESA's mission operations department. \n\"It's clear that these are not good signs, but we will need more information, and that's what's going to happen tonight,\" Ferri said. \"I'm quite confident that tomorrow morning we will know\" what happened, he added. \nIf Schiaparelli did stick its landing, the maneuver would mark the first fully successful Mars touchdown by Europe or Russia \u2014 by any entity other than NASA, as a matter of fact. Tag-teaming Mars \nSchiaparelli and TGO launched together in March, lifting off atop a Russian Proton rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. \nThe two spacecraft represent the first phase of the two-part ExoMars program, which is led by ESA with Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, as chief partner. The second phase of ExoMars will launch a life-hunting rover in 2020, if all goes according to plan. \nEurope is spending 1.3 billion euros ($1.43 billion at current exchange rates) on the ExoMars program, ESA officials have said. \nSchiaparelli and TGO traveled together until Sunday (Oct. 16), when they separated ahead of their divergent Mars arrivals. \nSchiaparelli reached the Red Planet first, hitting the thin Martian atmosphere at the blistering speed of 13,050 mph (21,000 km/h). Mission team members tracked the lander's progress this far, but they weren't able follow it all the way down to the surface. \n\"Initial signals [from Schiaparelli] were received via the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) as Schiaparelli descended to the surface of Mars, but no signal indicating touchdown yet,\" ESA officials wrote in a blog post this morning, referring to an array of dishes near Pune, India. \n\"This is not unexpected due to the very faint nature of the signal received at GMRT,\" they added. \"A clearer assessment of the situation will come when ESA's Mars Express [orbiter] will have relayed the recording of Schiaparelli's entry, descent and landing.\" \nBut the data from Mars Express \u2014 which has been circling the Red Planet since 2003 \u2014 were inconclusive, ESA officials later said, so Schiaparelli's fate remains uncertain. The situation should clear up by tomorrow, after mission team members have had more time to search for signals coming from the lander using GMRT, Mars Express and two other orbiters \u2014 NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) spacecraft. \nSchiaparelli came down in the Meridiani Planum, a highland region just south of the Martian equator. NASA's Opportunity rover touched down in Meridiani Planum back in January 2004 and is still going strong today. \nBut Schiaparelli won't come close to Opportunity's longevity, even if the probe survived today's touchdown intact: The ExoMars 2016 lander is powered by nonrechargeable batteries that should die in just a few days, ESA officials have said. That's because Schiaparelli is a landing demonstrator whose primary purpose is proving out technology required to get the ExoMars 2020 rover down on Mars safely. \nThe data Schiaparelli gathers would therefore be limited. The lander does feature a meteorological station to measure temperature, wind speed, humidity and other weather conditions on the Martian surface. Schiaparelli also was programmed to do some science work during its brief descent through the planet's atmosphere \u2014 for example, measuring air density, pressure and temperature from an altitude of 81 miles (130 km) down to the planet's surface, ESA officials said. \nThe plan also called for Schiaparelli to capture 15 black-and-white images as it fell. The lander's camera was not designed to take photos from the surface. \nInfographic: How Europe's ExoMars Missions to Mars Work Searching for signs of life \nTGO didn't have to withstand the \" six minutes of terror \" that confronted Schiaparelli, but the orbiter's arrival was harrowing in its own way. The spacecraft had to fire its main engine for 139 minutes beginning at 9:05 a.m. EDT (1305 GMT) today, or else go sailing past Mars and into orbit around the sun. \nBut TGO did its job, and the probe settled into a highly elliptical orbit around the Red Planet at 11:24 a.m. EDT (1524 GMT), ESA officials said. TGO's current four-day orbital path takes the spacecraft as close as 186 miles (300 km) to Mars and as far away as 60,000 miles (96,000 km), if the mission team's pre-arrival calculations reflect reality. \nBut TGO won't stay in this orbit forever. In March 2017, the spacecraft will begin a yearlong \"aerobraking\" campaign, shifting into a circular, 250-mile-high (400 km) orbit by zipping through the Martian atmosphere at high altitudes. (This will create drag that slows TGO and lowers its orbit.) \nBy March 2018, TGO should be ready to start its science mission, which involves searching the Martian atmosphere for methane and other gases that could be signs of alien life. (While methane can be produced by geological processes, the vast majority of the methane in Earth's atmosphere was generated by living organisms.) \nTGO will also hunt for deposits of water ice on or just below the Martian surface and serve as a communications relay for Opportunity, NASA's Curiosity rover and the ExoMars 2020 rover, ESA officials have said. TGO's mission is scheduled to end in December 2022. \nExploring Mars \nThe arrival of TGO brings the tally of active spacecraft at Mars up to eight. Two of them are surface craft \u2014 Opportunity and Curiosity \u2014 while the other six are orbiters: NASA's Mars Odyssey, MRO and MAVEN; Mars Express; India's Mars Orbiter Mission; and TGO. \nSchiaparelli could still be added to this list, though its inclusion would last just a few days (until its batteries run out). And more robotic explorers are headed to the Red Planet in the near future. NASA plans to launch a lander called InSight in 2018, to probe the interior structure of Mars. And two life-hunting rovers should follow in 2020: the ExoMars vehicle and NASA's 2020 Mars rover . \nFollow Mike Wall on Twitter @michaeldwall and Google+ .Follow us @Spacedotcom , Facebook or Google+ .

Jorge Duenes / REUTERS file Share advertisement \nA sudden recent shift in American deportation policy may have dire implications for thousands of Haitians, and cause a bleak homecoming for many in the wake of destruction brought by Hurricane Matthew. \nThe hurricane was billed as the most powerful storm to touch the Atlantic in nearly a decade as it made landfall in Haiti early Tuesday morning. At least 19 people were confirmed dead by the time the storm passed over the island of Hispaniola. \nAnd thousands more Haitians who are currently in America may soon face fallout from the disaster, all for a new change in United States immigration policies that critics warn is ill-fated and poorly timed.

Most all entered through southern California, overwhelming already stretched resources and raising alarms that many more would follow. \nIn announcing the policy change last month, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the situation in Haiti had \"improved sufficiently\" since it was hit by a devastating earthquake in 2010.

And a cholera epidemic brought by United Nations relief workers has killed at least 10,000 people over that same time period. Meanwhile, political instability has lurched the country into flashpoints of chaos. \nThe damage from Hurricane Matthew has even meant that the highly anticipated elections scheduled for the weekend would instead be postponed for a later date.

Reyes The Family Behind the 80-year Success of Goya Foods 4:22 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/787558979916\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nJERSEY CITY, N.J. \u2014 The windowed corner office of the president of Goya Foods is as homey as it is corporate. It is full of memorabilia: family photos, awards, an enlarged Crain's New York Business article , a Goya Foods poster featuring the flags of Latin America bearing the legend, \"United by language, separated by the bean.\" There is even a cowboy hat perched jauntily on a conga drum. \nBut the name on the office may surprise people. Although Goya Foods remains a family-owned company, the family that owns it is named Unanue. \nRobert Unanue, president of Goya Foods, explained to NBC News that it was his grandfather Prudencio Unanue who founded the company in 1936. Prudencio Unanue was an immigrant from Spain who first settled in Puerto Rico, and then in New York City. \nPrudencio Unanue imported Spanish products until the Spanish Civil War disrupted his business. Unable to get goods from Spain, Prudencio Unanue switched to Moroccan imports \u2014 one of which was a can of sardines bearing the name \"Goya.\" \nRELATED: These Latino Dishes Are Becoming All-American Favorites \nLiking the name's association with the great Spanish painter and the fact that it was easy to pronounce, Unanue bought the name for a dollar. The Unanue family has been behind the Goya brand ever since. \n\"Our grandfather took a leap into the great unknown (when he came here). He was looking for a taste of home, and he also provided a taste of home for everybody else that was coming to this country,\" said Unanue. \"As an immigrant, if you're coming in from Puerto Rico, Peru, Mexico, wherever you're coming in from\u2026 he made sure that the product that they were looking for was authentic.\" \nCelebrating its 80th anniversary this year, Goya Foods is now cementing its iconic status as the country's largest Hispanic foods company while simultaneously reaching further into the mainstream market. It employs over 4,500 people worldwide and produces and distributes over 2,500 products. In the U.S., Goya products are sold everywhere from corner bodegas to Costco. \nThat Goya Foods has such a long legacy of being at the forefront of Latino cuisine in the U.S. is no accident, said Unanue. There are three things that immigrants typically hold on to in a new country, he noted: their language, their music, and their food. \n\"Food is a great connection,\" said Unanue. Over the years, the company has harnessed their culinary connection to the nation's Latino immigrants, expanding it by becoming involved in the community's arts and sports programs. \"And that makes everybody feel part of Goya as a family,\" he said. \nThe Unanue family, and by extension Goya Foods, pride themselves on being an institution that is an intrinsic part of the Latino experience. Unanue said that when he meets people, they often tell him that they grew up on the company's products. \n\"They say I remember your slogans, I remember that you were in my neighborhood, you were part of my life growing up,\" he said. \"That's what makes us more than just a food company. We've become part of the culture and that's really exciting.\" \nRELATED: Why Top U.S. Chefs Seek This Young Latino's Quality Mexican Corn \nThe Unanue family's stewardship of Goya Foods is striking considering that, according to the Family Business Institute , only 12 percent of family-owned businesses reach the third generation. In contrast, at Goya Foods there are already fourth-generation Unanues working at the company (Robert Unanue first worked for the company at age ten when he spent a week working on a production line in Brooklyn for fifty cents an hour). Other employees have been with the company as long as 35 years. \nPeter Unanue, Executive Vice President of Goya Foods, said that the company's growth has paralleled the growth of the Latino population in the U.S. \nAs Hispanics arrived here from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and other Latin American countries, the firm has continuously expanded its offerings. \"That how we became what we call la gran familia Goya, \" he said. This includes not only the Unanue family and their employees, he said, but the millions of consumers who enjoy their products as well. \nGoya Foods, ranked by Forbes in 2015 as a $1.5 billion-in-sales business , has been investing heavily in reaching new consumers. Moving beyond the traditional Latino staples, Goya also offers gluten-free, low sodium, organic, and Kosher products. The company has 26 facilities throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Spain. \nWith this growth and success , however, have come challenges. Last month, a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit alleging that Goya Foods substituted squid for octopus in certain products could move forward. The company has faced union troubles , and product recalls over food safety concerns . \nThe Unanues themselves have seen their share of infighting. In 2004, the Wall Street Journal reported on a dispute over the direction of the company that led to the ousting of two family members as chief executive and as chief operating officer. \n\"Working with your family has its pros and cons. Mostly pros,\" Peter Unanue told NBC News. \"We all share a common vision; we all want what's best for the company for the employees for growth. So it's a lot of fun.\" He added that he always did his best to separate business from personal matters. \n\"It's a little bit difficult when we disagree,\" he said. \"But for the most part, you know, we have a common vision.\" \nRELATED: Hispanic Heritage Month: Meet the Rising Latino Food Stars \nBoth Unanue brothers agree that the key to the company's success is that it offers authentic, nutritious food. Robert Unanue pointed that many Goya products, like their beans, are not only good but highly nutritious. \nIn 2011, Goya Foods was honored by President Obama for its commitment to the Latino community. In 2012, the company teamed up with First Lady Michelle Obama as part of her campaign to promote healthy eating . \nRobert Unanue believes that if his grandfather Prudencio could see the company that he founded decades ago, he would be amazed. \n\"He planted that seed and there's so many people on the way that have worked in this company, who have come and gone, good friends, family members, employees - and they have built this,\" he said. \"I think he'd be so proud of planting the seed, and then seeing all the love, dedication, and hard work that was put behind bringing in that crop.\" \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

The talks came amid heightened urgency about the city of Aleppo, the latest flashpoint in a war that has killed up to a half-million people, sparked a refugee crisis and offered a territorial base to the radical Islamic State group. \nRelated: U.S. Attempts a New Approach to Syria Peace Talks in Switzerland \nKerry's new approach comes after last month's U.S.-Russian bid to end the war collapsed in days as Syrian forces backed by Russian airpower launched an offensive on rebel-held parts of Aleppo. \nMinisters put a brave face on the Lausanne meeting, which Kerry said was \"exactly what we wanted\" \u2014 a statement that testified mostly to low expectations. The main result was pledges to resume contact on Monday. \n\"Nobody wants to do this in a sloppy way,\" said Kerry, who only recently accused Moscow of war crimes.

For that to happen, Washington says the aerial onslaught in eastern Aleppo must stop. \nNeither side has budged in the chicken-and-egg dispute over months of negotiation. \nSaturday's talks included top envoys from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan. \nKerry said the discussion was driven by the \"urgency of Aleppo, the urgency of trying to find something that works other than military action.\" \nMinisters offered suggestions that \"really might be able to shape some different approaches,\" he said, without elaborating. No official news conference or joint statement followed Saturday's meeting. \nRelated: United States Suspends Contact With Russia Over Syria Impasse \nThe Syrian-Russian offensive in Aleppo prompted the U.S. to end discussions this month over a proposed military alliance against Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked militants. Last week, Kerry accused both parties of war crimes for targeting hospitals and civilian infrastructure in the Arab country. \nNevertheless, Kerry reunited with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the lakeside Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne, speaking with the Russian for almost 40 minutes before the larger gathering. For all the talk in Washington about a possible Plan B, U.S. hopes for diplomatic progress appeared to rest squarely on Russia's cooperation. \n\"There are a few ideas we discussed today in this circle of countries that can influence the situation,\" Lavrov told Russian news agencies. \"We agreed to continue contacts in the next few days aiming at agreements that could advance the settlement.

That argument is one that the AFL-CIO often makes in support of immigration reform. \nAs Clinton was explaining a comment she made about dreaming of open borders in an energy speech, things began to crumble. \nThe \"open borders\" remark came to light when Wikileaks posted a transcript of a speech she'd made online.

Hillary Clinton has argued for reform to root out implicit, and statistically proven, biases. Here's just one of the ways she called for police reform without accusing all officers of \"being racist.\" \n\"We've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias,\" Clinton said in the wake of the shooting of an unarmed man in Oklahoma last month. \"There are good, honorable, cool-headed police officers... We can do better. We have got to rein in what is absolutely inexplicable, and we've got to have law enforcement respect communities and communities respect law enforcement because they have to work together.\" 'Clinton Has Been There For 30 Years, and Hasn't Fixed Anything' \n\"Clinton has been there for 30 years, and hasn't fixed anything.\" - Trump, 10/5/2016 \nDonald Trump says this constantly, and it's worth some scrutiny, as Clinton held elected or appointed office for just 13 years. \nThirty years ago, Clinton was first lady of Arkansas; she went on to be the nation's first lady when husband Bill Clinton was elected to the White House 24 years ago. These roles carry clout, but no direct governing ability. Hillary Clinton was able to rally support around Congressional efforts to enact healthcare initiatives for children, but the bills weren't hers. \nShe was first sworn into office herself as a New York senator in 2001, and was later appointed secretary of state in 2009. She left that office in 2013, and hasn't held elected office since. \nWith just 13 years in elected or appointed office to her name, it's an overstatement to blame three decades of problems on her. 3 days ago Pence Says Clinton Will Raise Crowd's Taxes.

The latest Census found the median household income to be $38,807, so his claim about Clinton raising the crowd's taxes is wrong \u2014 her plan has only called for hiking taxes on the nation's wealthiest Americans, and no one else. \nThe conservative Tax Foundation's analysis of Trump's latest plan found that it would indeed lower taxes, though Pence seems to overstate how big those cuts would be. Everyone would get cuts of at least 0.8 percent more after-tax income, but it mostly boosts corporations and wealthy Americans like Trump himself: They would see 10 percent to 16 percent more income after taxes. 3 days ago Pence Denies Trump's Nuclear Views, While Kaine Oversimplifies It \n\"Don't put words in my mouth.

Here's the exchange on CNN that Kaine is referring to. \nTRUMP At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have\u2026 \nCOOPER: Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons? \nTRUMP: Saudi Arabia, absolutely. \nCOOPER: You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons? \nTRUMP: No, not nuclear weapons, but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us. Here's the thing, with Japan, they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves. \nCOOPER: So if you said, Japan, yes, it's fine, you get nuclear weapons, South Korea, you as well, and Saudi Arabia says we want them, too? \nTRUMP: Can I be honest with you? It's going to happen, anyway. It's going to happen anyway. It's only a question of time.

", "Like Naeem, you're also from Jackson Heights, a neighborhood with a large South Asian population. There are so many novels set in Brooklyn out right now, but there haven't been that many stories about Queens.\nI was born in Jackson Heights and I moved away when I was a little kid. This book is a love song in a lot of ways to Queens. There is definitely this new [literary] scene that's emerging. My prior novel \"Ask Me No Questions\" was also set in Queens but I don't think that I delved into the landscape as much until this book.\nThere are so many ways that Queens is a landscape and I feel like this is only the beginning.\nHow would you describe Naeem to someone who hasn't read your book?\nHe's a teenage boy who is very charming and tries to please everybody but he can't quite get it together. But for a boy like Naeem \u2014 he's a Muslim, he's an immigrant, his character is struggling, and there's a generational gap between him and his family \u2014 it sets him on more of an odyssey than what he's anticipated.\nMarina Budhos is also the author of the upcoming \"Eyes of the World: Robert Capa &amp; Gerda Taro &amp; The Invention of Modern Photojournalism,\" as well as \"Ask Me no Questions,\" the precursor to \"Watched.\" Franck Goldberg You don't really see a lot of working class people in YA. When we see stories about teenagers in New York, they are often Gossip Girl-esque books about very rich teens.\nThat's a great point. And it's not like I was setting out to write the YA working class novel. I saw as an odyssey story, where a young man has to travel away from his family and be shaped by the streets and then come back to his family and figure out who he is.\nNaeem is definitely more street, more working class, his parents are struggling. Those are the stories that move me. And what I like about writing about these themes is that they are stories of about ordinary striving and it isn't about these gilded and rarified worlds.\nYou mention in the acknowledgements that you read the AP's extensive, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into the NYPD's Muslim surveillance program. What was your first reaction when you read those stories?\nMy reaction was \"Oh my god.\" I feel like surveillance was something that was happening in a very profound way, but I didn't know it was happening at this level. When the story broke, I guess it sort of confirmed a hunch I had just started to follow. I think reading that investigation and also reading \"The Terror Factory\" by Trevor Aaronson kind of shocked me into wanting to do a novel about it.\nRELATED: New York City Settles Lawsuits Concerning Muslim Surveillance, Will Institute Reforms\nWhen Naeem was first approached by the cops, they immediately point out that his family can't help him if he were to get into trouble. Becoming an informant is presented to him as his only real choice.\nExactly. And I think he feels that way. Naeem is someone who's always dreamed big but he has a pretty vague sense of how he'd get there and he doesn't have the family background that can really help him. And the cops know that. They prey on that and some of that came out of research I had done with groups that work with immigrants that face this sort of interrogation.\nYou can tell Naeem is torn about agreeing to be an informant. What was it like getting into a character that knows he's doing something wrong, but keeps going?\nThe way I work as a writer, I don't have a story is until I have a character. The way I found my way to Naeem was a friend of mine was telling me about a young man who came into her law office who seemed to be boasting about the fact that he was an informant. He wasn't quite saying it, but his immigrant father ran a shop but he was like, \"But me, I am in the know. I am with the powers that be.\"\nI could have written this story where he's just a victim who is entrapped by the cops, but I think it's much more interesting to have a character that gets something out of this, who sees it as one more way of showing that he's a man and has a sense of power. I really wanted to explore a character who is drawn to it and who thinks that he is doing some good but then starts to have more misgivings.\nMuslim community members and supporters march near 1 Police Plaza to protest the New York Police Department surveillance operations of Muslim communities on Nov. 18, 2011, in New York. Bebeto Matthews / AP file You can see that in the scene where Naeem gives his stepmother two fifty dollar bills that he earned from his work. He's so proud that he's finally able to contribute to the household in a meaningful way.\nNaeem's conflict is that he really saw some heroics in it. And he's starting to gain a sense of strength being an informant, because he really had been a slacker before that. What I am also trying to portray is how confusing it is to be a young Muslim because of the question of what is the right form of protection. And this sent him down the road of betrayal, but it is a really difficult question.\nOne of the biggest revelations of the AP investigation was that there was this huge surveillance program, but it really didn't uncover information of any real importance.\nThe problem is that the program as it existed before \u2014 and we still don't know what's going on \u2014 I've spoken to various groups and they say that there is still some form of surveillance going on. And has you said, it came up with nothing except things like, \"they are watching soccer at the local cafe.\"\nOr there was that Gawker post about how the surveillance program revealed the best Muslim-owned restaurants in New York.\nRight. And there were thousands of these kinds of reports being produced and nothing came of the investigations.\nPlay Facebook Twitter Google Plus Embed What did NYPD Muslim unit actually uncover? 11:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog Do you usually gravitate towards immigrant issues and social justice in your writing?\nSome of my instincts as a journalist, even though I'm not quite a practicing journalist, is that I kind of find this alchemy into fiction in a \"what if\" mode. But in a broader sense, I think I am drawn to immigrant stories and to young people. So I don't know if that falls into a social justice mode or into the mode of really wanting to tell those invisible stories that are not as seen.\nWhat are you working on next?\nThe next book I'm writing is going to set in the late 1960s, early 1970s. The date hasn't been yet, but it's going to be the Queens of the integration era. So before the Queens we know now. And it's about two mixed race girls who are kind of caught in between a clash of black and white. They have partially immigrant backgrounds as well, but it's more about the era when there was a bussing plan and they are caught in between that.\nSo their backgrounds are similar to yours. [Budhos is part Indo-Caribbean.]\nYes. I wanted to deal with what it was like to be mixed race at a time when the world was more polarized.

Though the majority have moved to the I-4 Corridor in Central Florida, Miami is also seeing growing numbers, with more Puerto Rican Spanish accents heard in in the city's malls, supermarkets. \nRelated: Puerto Ricans Flex Their Political Muscle in Florida \nSome groups such as Nicaraguans and Venezuelans have voted or leaned Republican. But according to pollster and Democrat Fernand Amandi, of Bendixen & Amandi, exit polls conducted after the 2012 elections indicated that Nicaraguans and Venezuelans were switching to the Democratic Party. \nThese voter trends are what allowed Obama to win the Latino vote in Miami-Dade County and carry the state of Florida ; Obama won Florida's Hispanic vote 60 percent to 39 percent for Mitt Romney. More Latino diversity has made immigration a bigger issue \nSome may dismiss the importance of the immigration issue here, because U.S. policy grants expedited citizenship to Cubans who arrive on U.S. soil. But again, the increasingly diverse Latino population here has changed that.

Joe Raedle / Getty Images \nAmong Latinos that have participated in focus groups organized by Gamarra, immigration is an important topic, even for those Latinos who are citizens. \nIn Miami, it's difficult not to know someone who is undocumented or isn't affected by immigration laws. Gamarra who is a U.S. citizen has students who arrived or stayed in the country illegally, often because their parents did not have the legal permission to be here. \n\"Immigration is more than just a public policy issue to us. We look at immigration as an emotional, cultural status,\" Gamarra said. \nBut opinions are as diverse as the Latinos in Miami. \nMayra Joli, a Dominican-American immigration attorney, is a registered Democrat and a Trump supporter. She said she wants the country to go back to the values it had in the 1990s when she immigrated here. She says too much political correctness is destroying the nation's values, such as the removal of the Confederate flag from state and federal buildings. She does not see Trump as anti-immigrant like some in the Latino community. \n\"I know it doesn't work to have immigration reform for everyone and it doesn't work to deport everyone, which means those extremes have to come to a middle ground,\" Joli said. epa05585554 Cubans living in exile shout slogans supporting US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's candidacy in Miami, Florida, USA, 14 October 2016.

He is \"the least popular among Hispanic voters in modern election history,\" Amandi said. \nRepublican Jorge L. Arrizurieta, who was chair of the Jeb Bush campaign in South Florida, said \"the reason why he [Trump] may have some acceptance in some pockets on the Cuban-American community is because there is a strong anti-Hillary sentiment.\" \nArrizurieta is not voting for Trump and said he \"personifies everything you raise your children not to be.\" On the Ground, Clinton is Leading \nThe Clinton campaign is ahead, as far as the ground game in Miami-Dade. \nThe campaign has nine offices throughout Miami-Dade, dozens of staffers and hundreds of volunteers working throughout the county to register voters and turn out the vote, according to a campaign aide.

A federal judge recently extended the deadline because of the havoc Hurricane Matthew has caused. \n\"I know Trump is spiraling, but Florida is always a close election and we're not taking any vote for granted,\" Cuba said. \nThe party has found the majority of people to register outside of post offices, bus stops, supermarkets and other areas, finding many Latinos and African-Americans to sign up.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson LUCY NICHOLSON / Reuters \nThis year, Hispanic voters make up a larger share of Miami-Dade's registered voters compared to previous election cycles. There were 745,380 Hispanic registered voters as of August, which is an increase of almost 40,000 since 2012 when there were 709,445 registered voters before the general election. \nThe number of Latino voters claiming no party affiliation also has grown. But Republicans still outnumber Democrats among Hispanic registered voters in Miami-Dade. There were 267,881 Hispanic Republicans and 230,517 Hispanic Democrats as of August 2016, according to the Florida Division of Elections . \nTrump has relied heavily on the Republican National Committee (RNC) and the state party for registering people to vote and for knocking door-to-door. In mid-September, the Florida headquarters were moved from Sarasota to Orlando, which is more centrally located. At that point, it had been the only Trump campaign office in Florida. \n\"We are the ones who have been on the ground talking to the voters for the better part of two years. While they were out campaigning, we were out setting it up for the general elections,\" Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia said. Cuban Americans support US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's candidacy in Miami, Florida, USA, 14 October 2016. CRISTOBAL HERRERA / EPA \nTrump now has 23 field offices in the state of Florida - two are in Miami-Dade county, according to his campaign website . Ingoglia said the highest number of staff and volunteers are located in Miami-Dade and the I-4 corridor. \nIn contrast, during the last election cycle, when Mitt Romney was nominated, around 20 campaign offices were opened by May in Florida, according to a Florida Republican speaking on background. \nWith Trump, \"it's difficult to show up last minute to engage people - if it weren't for the RNC's efforts, there would have been a void before September,\" said the Florida Republican. Most Miami GOP Cuban-American leaders don't support Trump \nU.S. GOP Senator Marco Rubio still supports Trump, though in an appearance over the weekend with vice presidential candidate Mike Pence he didn't mention Trump by name. Rubio is in the minority, though. \nTrump doesn't have strong support among the mostly Cuban-American Republican leadership in Miami-Dade. Many of these leaders didn't endorse Trump from the beginning. \nU.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Carlos Curbelo have said they will not support Trump, though they have stopped short of endorsing Clinton. \nCarlos Gutierrez, a Cuban-American Republican who was Commerce Secretary under George W. Bush endorsed Clinton. Her campaign created an advertising campaign in September around his endorsement. \nIn it, Gutierrez says in Spanish he has been Republican all his life, but he's an American before anything else, a common sentiment among Cuban Americans. He goes on to say he cannot vote for Trump because he's dangerous. \nCuban-American Miami billionaire Mike Fernandez, who was a top donor for Jeb Bush during the primaries, has called Trump an \"abysmally unfit candidate.\" He has donated over $2 million to help Clinton's campaign with Latino outreach in Florida. \nIn an op-ed at the end of August he wrote: \"As a Republican who has contributed millions of dollars to the party's causes, I ask: Why has our party not sought a psychological evaluation of its nominee?\" \nMayors Tomas Regalado of Miami and Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County - both Republican - have refused to support Trump. Gimenez, who is up for re-election said during a mayoral debate that he would vote for Clinton and that Trump should step down as his party's nominee. \nThe Latin Builders Association, which touts itself as the largest Hispanic construction group in the country, endorsed Clinton this week. It was the first time the mostly Cuban-American and conservative-leaning group has backed a Democrat for president. \nClinton Must Energize Florida Latinos to Turn Out \nIt's not enough for Clinton to have an edge among Latino registered voters in Florida. To win the state, Latinos need to turn out in force for her to win Florida's crucial 29 electoral votes. \nArrizurieta thinks Clinton might get an extra push during the coming weeks. \n\"In the next 30 days whoever has been anti-Trump and not been pro-Hillary will gravitate towards Hillary,\" he said. \nTraditionally, Latinos vote in much lower numbers than blacks and other minority groups. Only 48 percent of Hispanic eligible voters actually cast ballots in the 2012 election. \nKennie Silva, 36, an office manager at a Miami dance school, was born in California after her parents fled the civil war that ravaged El Salvador in the 1980s. She's Republican and prefers Trump, but she said chances are, she won't vote for him Nov. 8. \n\"I'm of the mindset that at the end, my vote doesn't really count,\" she said. \nIn Florida, almost half of the population is under 29. Millennials, generally 18-35, are not reliable when it comes to voting. In the 2014 midterm elections, only 41 percent of registered voters cast a ballot in Miami-Dade. \nMany analysts agree that for Trump to win Florida he must garner more support from Hispanics than John McCain and Mitt Romney did in their failed presidential bids in 2008 and 2012, respectively. \nArrizurieta is not optimistic about voter turnout this year. \n\"You will sure have a greater number of abstentions staying at home,\" he said. \"That number might be greater than people think. And we won't know that until after the elections.\" \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Fourteen migrants died in the area this year trying to stow away on wagons or trucks. \nTheir nightly cat-and-mouse game with border police became a symbol of European governments inability to get to grips with the migrant crisis. The existence of the camp has also become an issue in France's presidential election. \nIn Britain, concern over immigration was one of the main drivers of this year's \"Brexit\" vote to leave the European Union. \nFrench President Francois Hollande earlier this year announced authorities would clear \"The Jungle\" and officials began planning a complex operation to relocate migrants in hundreds of reception centers and shelters across the country. \nOn Monday, 60 buses were set to transport 3,000 migrants to an unknown future. \nBy week's end, the camp is expected to be emptied and destroyed. \nRelated: Trump Wants Border Wall, But U.K. Is Already Building One \nClashes broke out overnight as some migrants fled the camp early to avoid arrest or deportation, many of them setting fire to shelters and portable toilets in a final act of protest.

JONATHAN DRAKE / Reuters \nLOS ANGELES, California \u2014 From the initial launch of his campaign to his third and final debate, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has touted a simple yet dangerous media narrative: (1) America ceased being great because of (2) border raiding illegal immigrants (\"murderers and rapists\") and (3) trade agreements like NAFTA and TPP which produce trade deficits that take U.S. jobs. \nIn Trump's view, real American working people are hurt as America's border is being overrun by the \"worst\" people Mexico is sending and because of \"unfair\" trade deals made by \"our bad leaders.\" \nHis magical solution that can \"make America great again\" is to build a Great Wall, deport millions, and impose high tariffs. \nTrump's popularity was too readily conflated by many observers with the actual existence of measurable negative impacts from trade and migration on the lives of Trump supporters, as well as evidence for the need for more restrictive immigration and trade policy responses. \nSome went further, explicitly postulating a positive relationship between Trump's support among voters and \"China Shock\" trade exposure, reporting that \"[i]n this year's Republican presidential primary races, Mr. Trump won 89 of the 100 counties most affected by competition from China, according to an analysis published in The Wall Street Journal. Fewer voters are likely to support Trump in areas with more Mexican immigrants and higher exposure to imports from Mexico and China. \nHowever, a newly released detailed examination at UCLA of the geographical concentration of support for Trump in the presidential primaries among all 3,014 U.S. counties directly contradicts the Trump narrative. \nTrump support, in fact, was highly concentrated in counties that contain very few Mexican immigrants and are less exposed to imports from Mexico or China. \nEqually contradictory to the Trump narrative, our analysis shows that fewer voters are likely to support Trump in areas with higher contact with Mexican migrants and higher exposure to imports from Mexico and China. \nThose counties with higher concentrations of Mexican immigrants and imports from Mexico and China are actually more likely to support another Republican candidate or Hillary Clinton. In fact, less than 2 percent of U.S. counties actually fit the Trump narrative of very high Trump support combined with very high levels of immigration or trade. By contrast, nearly 60 percent of counties are polarized as either high Trump/low Mexican or low Trump/high Mexican counties. \nWhile these results specifically refute and even invert the Trump narrative, they also confirm that Donald Trump enjoys high levels of support in particular regions which are struggling economically, containing high concentrations of White poverty, high unemployment rates and a low median income. \nLow levels of migration and trade appear to actually be symptoms of the chronic stagnation and lack of competitiveness of these areas, rather than the result of too much migration and trade in Trump's narrative. \nIt is critical that we not learn the wrong lesson from the 2016 election and be swayed by the assumed \"political necessities\" of implementing anti-immigrant and anti-trade policies in order to \"address the legitimate concerns of Trump voters.\" \nThe right lessons from the false Trump narrative for future U.S. and Mexico policy makers is that neither the causes nor the solutions for these lagging regional dynamics are related to U.S. migration policies, or to trade relationships with China and Mexico. \nRa\u00fal Hinojosa Ojeda is the Executive Director of the North American Integration and Development Center (NAID) at UCLA. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

She says she is \"most definitely voting\" on Election Day, but adds that the level of negativity is so nerve-wracking that she prefers not to say which candidate she'll pick on November 8. \n\"Election season is always a difficult time, especially for its impact on important relationships where families and friends have different points of view,\" said Bauz\u00e1. \"This election has been particularly disruptive in that regard.

Margarita Bauz\u00e1 / Margarita Bauza \nThe political vitriol is so bad this year that an American Psychological Association survey found that more than half say this campaign has been \"a very or somewhat significant source of stress.\" That is particularly true for Latinos in battleground states like Michigan as they watch the constant barrage of ads and campaigning. \nMore than 230,000 Michigan Hispanics are eligible to vote this year , representing nearly half of the state's Latino residents. Latinos are 5 percent of Michigan's population and 3 percent of the electorate but their numbers are expected to at least double by 2040. That number of Hispanic voters, say groups involved in voter registration efforts this year, will likely be larger once the final tally is calculated after the election. \nHispanics are not just recent arrivals; many may not know that Michigan had a significant Mexican-American population that shrank after the state took measures during the Depression to support the return of workers to Mexico. \nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton continues to enjoy widespread support among Latino voters nationwide. The latest Latino Decisions/Telemundo tracking poll shows Latinos backing Clinton 66 percent compared to just 15 percent for her GOP rival Donald Trump . Of the 11 states - including Michigan -- likely to determine the winner on November 8, President Obama swept them all in 2008 and all except one in 2012. Latino voters in Michigan believe that not only will Clinton likely repeat those wins, but the margin will be larger because of one factor: Donald Trump. \nRELATED: Clinton Beats Trump Among Latinos 76 Percent to 14 Percent \n\"Our choices in this election are so stark, and the vitriol and threats and fear-mongering and such coming from Donald Trump truly are scary,\" said Cynthia Orosco, a resident of suburban Detroit who works in the advertising field. \"I also think it's scary, as the mother of a young daughter, that his candidacy has given such a broad forum to people who share discriminatory, sexist, and racist points of view \u2014 we're all entitled to our opinions, but perpetuating hate serves no purpose,\" she said. \nThat \"ugliness\" that Orosco mentions is a recurring theme among Latino voters in the Great Lake State. \nRELATED: Latino Vote is 'Front and Center' in Colorado \nCynthia's mother, Juanita Orosco, also a Clinton supporter, is a 65-year-old retired autoworker who has been voting for decades, but says this election is unique - and not in a positive way. \"This is the worst and ugliest election I have seen in my life.\" \nMany of Michigan's more than 230,000 Latino voters mirror the rest of the country's Hispanic voters in backing Clinton, but also express a level of dissatisfaction overall - just like voters in other states, according to the polls.

Patricia Guadalupe ", "Current position: If I win the presidency, I don't see a problem with our electoral system.\nRIGGED SYSTEM 1. It's rigged!\nLocked in a heated primary battle with Ted Cruz, Trump said the political system was a \"rigged, disgusting, dirty system.\"\n2. I won so it's OK.\n\"You've been hearing me say it's a rigged system, but now I don't say it anymore because I won. It's true. Now I don't care. I don't care,\" Trump said in May when he secured the nomination.\n3. Be careful though, it's still rigged.\n\"Nov. 8, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged,\" he said August 1st in Ohio in a claim PolitiFact rated 'pants on fire' wrong. \"People are going to walk in and they're going to vote 10 times, maybe, who knows?\"\n3. It's rigged by the media.\nWith polls showing Trump trailing Clinton consistently, he challenged the legitimacy of the election and the polls he once championed.\n\"The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her president,\" Trump said October 15th.\n4. It's rigged by voter fraud and the media!\n\"The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD,\" he tweeted.\n5. Everything's rigged!\n\"When the people who control the political power in our society can rig investigations like her investigation was rigged, can rig polls, you see these phony polls, and rig the media, they can wield absolute power over your life, your economy, and your country, and benefit big time by it. They control what you hear and what you don't hear. What is covered, how it's covered, even if it's covered at all,\" Trump said at a Florida rally on October 24th.\nIMMIGRATION 1. Build a wall, deport all undocumented immigrants.\nTrump's campaign began with a promise to build a wall across the United States' southern border and deport the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n2. Deport all undocumented immigrants but bring the \"good\" ones back legally.\nIn a CNN interview in July 2015, Trump said, \"I want to move them out, and we're going to move them back in and let them be legal, but they have to be in here legally.\"\n FROM AUG. 15, 2015: Obama's Immigration Executive Order Will Be 'Rescinded,' Trump Vows 0:27 3. Build the wall, deport criminals, triple the number of ICE officers, end birthright citizenship. In August 2015, Trump released a detailed, sprawling immigration plan that included a wide variety of ideas: Build the wall, make Mexico pay for it, deport criminal aliens, enhance penalties for overstaying visas, triple the number of ICE officers, pause immigration to try and employ unemployed Americans, cut worker visas and more. Trump's plan didn't detail how he'd enact most of his proposals, or how he'd pay for them. He's walked back or modified much of it since. 4. Use a deportation force to implement policy.\nIn November 2015, Trump said he'd use a mass deportation force in order to remove the 11 million people.\n\"You're going to have a deportation force. And your going to do it humanely,\" Trump said in November on MSNBC.\n5. Trump might be flexible on actually deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants.\nBuzzFeed report ed in February 2016 that in off-the-record talks with The New York Times , Trump admitted this was just bluster and a starting point for negotiations, saying he might not deport the undocumented immigrants as he's promised. Trump has refused calls to release the transcript, despite furious requests from his rival candidates.\n6. Deport undocumented immigrants, but don't call it \"mass deportations.\"\n\"President Obama has mass deported vast numbers of people \u2014 the most ever, and it's never reported. I think people are going to find that I have not only the best policies, but I will have the biggest heart of anybody,\" Trump told Bloomberg News in June 2016 when pressed about his immigration policies.\nWhen asked more about how he'd characterize the deportations at the center of his immigration policy, Trump said he \"would not call it mass deportations.\"\n7. A deportation force is \"TBD.\"\nTrump's newly hired campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, dodged questions on the deportation force in August 2016 before saying that Trump's much-talked about deportation force from the primary was \"to be determined.\"\n8. \"I'm gonna do the same\" as past presidents.\nTrump championed President Obama's immigration strategy \u2014 deporting criminals first \u2014 in an interview with Fox News on Monday, August 22 when asked about how he'd deport 11 million illegal immigrants. He declined to answer questions of how he'd handle those who aren't criminals.\n9. I'm open to \"softening.\"\nThe next day, Trump told attendees of a town hall hosted by Fox News in Texas that he was open to \"softening\" laws to help immigrants already living in the United States peacefully. However, he followed that by saying that those who had overstayed visas \u2014 one of the key ways undocumented immigrants get into the U.S. \u2014 had to leave. \"You have to get them out. You have to get them out,\" Trump said.\nIt's unclear what or how he's softening his policy.\n10. \"There's no amnesty\" but \"we work with them.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity that aired Wednesday, August 24, Trump outlined an immigration plan that sounded an awful lot like the kind of path to legalization championed by Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 the very people Trump excoriated for weak immigration plans while he campaigned on a promise of mass deportations.\n\"No citizenship. Let me go a step further \u2014 they'll pay back-taxes, they have to pay taxes, there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them,\" Trump said.\n11. Deport \"criminal illegal immigrants\" within one hour of being sworn in.\nTrump worked to sound strong on illegal immigration at an event in Iowa on Saturday, August 27 \u2014 even if he was simply presenting a warp-speed version of current policy.\n\"On day one, I am going to begin swiftly removing criminal illegal immigrants from this country,\" he said . \"We are going to get rid of the criminals, and it will happen within one hour\" of being sworn in.\nTrump did not discuss how he would approach the millions of other undocumented immigrants, nor did he explain how he could accomplish implementing current policy so quickly.\n12. What's the plan again?\nOn Sunday, August 28, three Trump surrogates took to the airwaves to insist that Trump's immigration plan hadn't changed. But their answers on what that plan actually was \u2014 and is \u2014 only added to the confusion.\nRunning mate Gov. Mike Pence said there would be no path to citizenship, while Gov. Chris Christie said there would be no legalization at all. Campaign manager Kellyanne Conway dodged answering the question completely, simply saying he'd be humane.\n\"The question is what to do,\" she said.\n13. A deportation force is not currently being discussed.\nConway built on her August 28 interview when she said a deportation force was to be decided by saying it wasn't presently being discussed.\n\"He is not talking about a deportation force,\" she said.\n14. The plan \u2014 whatever the plan is \u2014 has never changed.\n\"Absolutely consistent,\" said Pence.\n\"Completely consistent,\" said Christie.\n\"Pretty consistent,\" said Conway.\n15. Deport all undocumented immigrants in due time, using a deportation force.\nTwo more surrogates muddled Trump's immigration policy just days later.\nSon Donald Trump, Jr. told CNN on August 30 that his father hoped to deport everyone.\n\"That's been the same, correct. But again, you have to start with baby steps. You have to let ICE do their job, you have to eliminate sanctuary cities, you have to get rid of the criminals certainly first and foremost, you have to secure the border. These are common sense things, Anderson,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, Trump surrogate Jack Kingston told MSNBC that a deportation force \"is part of it. We are going to learn more Wednesday.\"\n16. Don't worry, hardliners. There's no amnesty and Mexico will pay!\nIn a speech in Phoenix on September 1 Trump eased base concerns and re-upped his harsh immigration rhetoric by insisting that he would create a deportation task force, and there would be no \"amnesty.\"\nMere hours after meeting with the Mexican president who later said he'd told Trump that Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall, Trump reiterated that he still planned to make Mexico pay for the wall.\n17. But \"there's really quite a bit of softening.\"\nLater the day, Trump was pressed by conservative commentator Laura Ingraham about what had happened to \"the softening\" of his policy. He said \"there's softening,\" but didn't indicate what, exactly, was softening.\n\"Look, we do it in a very humane way, and we're going to see with the people that are in the country. Obviously I want to get the gang members out, the drug peddlers out, I want to get the drug dealers out. We've got a lot of people in this country that you can't have, and those people we'll get out,\" Trump said. \"And then we're going to make a decision at a later date once everything is stabilized ... I think you're going to see there's really quite a bit of softening.\"\n18. I won't rule out a path to citizenship.\nAsked September 6 if he'd rule out a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Trump declined.\n\"I'm not ruling out anything,\" Trump said. \"We're going to make that decision into the future. OK?\" 19. We'll pay for the wall, Mexico will pay us back, OK?\n\"The End Illegal Immigration act fully funds the construction of a wall on our southern border,\" Trump said on October 22nd, outlining the plans for his first 100 days in office. \"With the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall, OK?\"\nCurrent position: Trump says he will deport millions, but he has not ruled out creating a pathway to citizenship. He'll build a wall, pay for said wall, but later he'll get reimbursed by Mexico.\nYOUNG UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 1. Dreamers can maybe stay.\nTrump wavered on what to do with the Dreamers \u2014 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to this country by their parents as children who are now afforded limited protection from deportation via the DREAM Act but no path to citizenship.\nWhen asked if Dreamers would have to go back, he said, \"It depends.\"\n2. Nope, they can't stay.\nBy August 2015, that ambiguity was gone: \"They have to go,\" he said on \"Meet the Press.\"\n3. End birthright citizenship.\nTrump first proposed ending the 14th Amendment \u2014 the Constitutional provision that grants citizenship to those born in the country \u2014 last August. This is something few in his party agree on, and it's even more unclear how it would be applied: Does it apply to children of mixed status parents, where one parent is illegal? Or simply those with two undocumented immigrant parents? Would he revoke the citizenship of the estimated 4.5 million children born to illegal immigrants already here?\nThe Trump campaign did not answer questions from reporters at the time.\n4. \"American children\" also deserve dreams.\n\"Where is the sanctuary for American children?\" Trump asked during a late August rally while alluding Dreamers.\n\"The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans. Why aren't young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans,\" he said, offering up a rhetorical device in place of policy.\nCurrent position: Deport children benefiting for the DREAM Act and repeal the 14th Amendment to end birthright citizenship.\nPROPOSED MUSLIM BAN 1. No Muslims should be allowed to enter the United States \u2014as immigrants or visitors.\nDonald Trump called for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\" in a statement about \"preventing Muslim immigration\" in December.\n2. Ban Muslims from entering but make an exception for friends and Muslims serving in the US military.\nHe later amended his stance in an interview with Fox News, saying the 5,000 Muslims serving the United States military would be exempt from the ban and allowed to return home from overseas deployments. He also suggested that current Muslim residents \u2014 like his \"many Muslim friends\" \u2014 would be exempt, too, and able to come and go freely.\n3. The Muslim ban was just an suggestion.\n\"We have a serious problem, and it's a temporary ban - it hasn't been called for yet, nobody's done it, this is just a suggestion until we find out what's going on,\" Trump said on in mid-May, softening for the first time in months on the ban.\n4. Ban Muslims as a matter of policy, as well as people from countries with a history of terrorism.\nIn a national security address after the terror attack in Orlando, Trump said that if he's elected he would \"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there's a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats.\"\n5. Ban people from countries with a history of terrorism.\nWhen a reporter asked Trump how he'd feel about a Muslim Scot entering the U.S. while on a trip to visit his golf courses in Scotland, Trump said it \"wouldn't bother me.\" He then went on to emphasize that he did not want \"people coming in from the terror countries.\" When asked, Trump would not name one such country.\n6. Ban Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism, and potentially also other Muslims.\nThat same day, when pressed about how his statement in Scotland jived with Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the country, spokesman Hope Hicks said that the ban would just apply to Muslims from countries with a history of terrorism. She would not, however, confirm that Muslims residing in peaceful countries would be exempt.\n7. The Muslim ban was never about Muslims.\nThe next week, one spokesperson wrongly said the initial ban was not about Muslims.\n\"I know the news media has been reporting that the initial ban was against all Muslims, and that simply was not the case. It's simply for Muslim immigration, and Mr. Trump is adding specifics to clarify what his position is,\" Katrina Pierson told CNN, though advisers at the time said it was indeed about religion exclusively.\n8. Nothing has changed, nothing to see here.\n\"This is not accurate,\" spokesperson Hope Hicks said when asked if the policies were changing and removing the word \"Muslim.\" \"There has been no change from the exchanges over the weekend.\"\n9. The ban is negotiable.\nThen-campaign manager Paul Manafort in late May said the Muslim ban was negotiable, and how Trump initially articulated it was not what it would turn out in the end. Manafort said the policy is currently that \"where there is terrorist activity \u2014 Syria or Iraq \u2014 we will temporarily suspend immigration until we can establish a vetting system in which we can identify who people are who are coming in.\"\nThe government already has a rigorous, nine-step vetting process in place for refugees. Trump has previously included all Syrian refugees, including children and non-Muslims, in the ban.\n10. The ban would call for \"extreme vetting.\"\nMid July, Trump told \"60 Minutes\" that people from suspicious \"territories\" would receive \"a thing called 'extreme vetting.'\" He did not describe how \"extreme vetting\" would differ from the current vetting process.\n\"Call it whatever you want,\" Trump told CBS when asked if he was changing his previously released policy.\n11. The ban hasn't changed, I just don't like saying the word \"Muslim.\"\nOn Fox News in late July , Trump told Sean Hannity his position hadn't changed from his initial ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\"I think my position's gotten bigger, I'm talking about territories now. People don't want me to say Muslim\u2014I guess I'd prefer not saying it, frankly, myself. So we're talking about territories.\"\n12. There's a ban, plus \"extreme vetting\" that includes an ideological test.\n\"The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today,\" Trump said in a speech in mid-August that reiterated his call for \"extreme vetting\" and reiterated that he'd temporarily ban immigration from some countries that he declined to identify.\nHe then proposed an ideological test for immigration.\n\"In addition to screening out all members or sympathizers of terrorist groups, we must also screen out any who have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles \u2015 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law,\" he said.\n13. There's no way to really do an ideological test.\n\"We don't know if they have love or hate in their heart,\" Trump said in September, articulating the problem many onlookers have expressed about his ban. \"There's no way to tell.\"\n14. Only people who love America are allowed.\nLater, despite acknowledging the impossibility of the task, Trump maintained that an ideological test is key to the nation's immigration system.\n\"We want to make sure we're only admitting those into our country who support our values and love - and I mean love - our people,\" he said.\n15. The ban has \"morphed.\"\nTrump was pressed on whether or not the Muslim ban still exists during the second presidential debate, and insisted that it was now only extreme vetting.\n\"The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into an extreme vetting from certain areas of the world,\" Trump said, without actually saying whether or not the ban on travel still stands. \"It's called extreme vetting.\"\n FROM OCTOBER 9: Trump: Muslim Ban Has Morphed Into 'Extreme Vetting' 0:57 Current position: Trump will not say whether or not he intends to ban people of Muslim faith from the U.S., but he will say that \"extreme vetting\" will apply to people from certain countries. It's unclear where those countries are, what \"extreme vetting\" entails or how he intends to institute an ideological test for entry.\nWHETHER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS BORN IN AMERICA 1. I don't know.\n\"I really don't know. I mean, I don't know why he wouldn't release his records. But you know, honestly, I don't want to get into it,\" Trump said in July 2015, asked about his inaccurate, years-long insistence that the president wasn't born in the United States. (President Obama had released his long form birth certificate in 2011.)\n2. I don't want to answer the question.\n\"I don't talk about that anymore,\" Trump said on MSNBC in December 2015 in response to a question about whether or not he believed President Obama was born in the United States.\n3. I'll explain my theory one day.\n\"Who knows [if Obama is a natural-born citizen]? Who knows? Who cares right now? We're talking about something else, OK? I'm going to have my own theory on Obama. Someday I'll write a book, I'll do another book that will do successfully,\" Trump said in January 2016.\n4. I'll only answer that question at the \"right time.\"\n\"I'll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump said mid-September 2016. \"I just don't want to answer it yet.\"\n5 . The president was born in the United States. \"Period.\"\n\"President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period,\" Trump said after a lengthy press conference touting his new hotel and veteran support.\n FROM SEPTEMBER 16: Trump: Obama Was Born in the United States, Period 0:43 6. She started it, I finished it by getting the birth certificate.\nIn his dismissal of the conspiracy theory he'd championed, Trump inaccurately claimed that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton started the conspiracy theory.\n7. I only said it to \"get on\" with the campaign.\nAsked what changed to prompt his reversal after nurturing a conspiracy theory for five years, Trump said he acknowledged the president's birthplace to \"get on with \u2014 I wanted to get on with the campaign.\"\n8. I didn't say Obama was American because no one was asking.\nPressed in the first debate on September 26 on why Trump didn't lay the birther conspiracy to rest in the five years after Obama released his long-form birth certificate, the Republican candidate falsely claimed he didn't publicly affirm his belief that Obama is an American citizen because he wasn't asked.\n\"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\" Trump said. \"I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it\"\n9. Clinton started it, and she's the one who should apologize, not me.\nTrump inaccurately insisted, again, that Clinton's campaign started the rumor, and said she should apologize to the president for it.\nCurrent position: Trump said he believes Obama was born in the United States because it is better for his campaign, but he continues to inaccurately argue Clinton started the birther movement \u2014 and that she should apologize for it.\nDEFEATING ISIS 1. Maybe send troops in. Definitely go after the oil fields.\nIn Trump's first interview after announcing his bid, he signaled that he'd both send in ground troops to Iraq and not send in ground troops.\n\"You bomb the hell out of them, and then you encircle it, and then you go in,\" he told Bill O'Reilly, who remarked that the plan necessitated ground forces. \"I disagree, I say that you can defeat ISIS by taking their wealth \u2014 their wealth is the oil.\"\n2. Bomb the oil fields. Send some troops in.\nOn CNN, Trump said, \"I would bomb the hell out of those oil fields. I wouldn't send many troops because you won't need them by the time I'm finished.\"\n FROM MARCH 30: Trump Declines to Rule Out Using Nuclear Weapons Against ISIS 1:59 3. Send troops to defeat ISIS. Don't forget about the oil fields.\nIn a single August interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" he offered three solutions for what to do with the oil field profits: keep them, give them to veterans and their families, or, when pressed, perhaps give some to the Iraqi people.\nMonths later, in a March debate, Trump ballparked the number of troops he would need to send in to defeat ISIS.\n\"We really have no choice, we have to knock out ISIS,\" Trump said. \"I would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000-30,000.\"\n4. I've got this! I know more than the generals.\n\"I know more about ISIS than the generals do,\" Trump said in November in Iowa. \"Believe me.\"\n5. Destroy the oil. Let our regional allies send ground troops. If they don't, stop buying their oil.\nIn a foreign-policy focused interview with the New York Times published March 26, Trump said that the U.S. should \"take\" ISIS' oil, but then said the U.S. should \"knock the hell out of the oil and do it because it's a primary source of money for ISIS.\" Trump also ruled out sending in U.S. troops, saying that other countries in the region \u2014 \"regional Arab partners\" such as Saudi Arabia \u2014 should provide the ground troops. If these countries did not, the United States would stop buying their oil and withhold \"protection\" in the region.\n6. Declare war, send in some troops.\n\"We're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS,\" Trump said in his first interview with running mate Gov. Mike Pence. \"I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need; which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there.\"\nTrump said he'd involve NATO, despite the fact that he has said the U.S. should withdraw from NATO, and the surrounding states, as well. He added that Hillary Clinton created ISIS. ( PolitiFact deemed this statement to be false .)\n7. I'm going to ask the generals.\nMonths after saying he knew more than the generals, Trump said in early September that he'd ask them to map out a plan for defeating ISIS.\n\"Immediately after taking office, I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS,\" he said. \"This will require military warfare, but also cyber warfare, financial warfare, and ideological warfare.\"\n8. He's got a plan, and he'll tell you if asked.\n\"I've heard it,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said on MSNBC. \"He'll tell you if that question is asked. He'll be happy to offer specifics without telling the enemy exactly what we're going to do.\"\n9. Do more with computers.\nTrump cited his 10-year-old's proficiency with computers to argue that the U.S. needed to better fight ISIS using the internet.\n\"When you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game, ISIS,\" Trump said. \"So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is \u2014 it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable.\"\nCurrent position: It's still unclear what Trump's plan to defeat ISIS is, but it will involve computers and it will be tough.\n'FIRST USE' AND NUCLEAR ARMS 1. I wouldn't strike first.\nAsked during the first presidential debate about whether he'd support 'first use,\" an un-official U.S. prohibition on the use of nuclear weapons against enemies who don't have nuclear capability, Trump said he wouldn't strike first -- a completely different issue.\n\"I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it,\" he said of nuclear weapons. \"But I would certainly not do first strike.\"\n FROM SEPTEMBER 24: Trump: 'Can't Take Anything Off the Table' with Nuclear Weapons 0:58 2. Or maybe I would.\nShortly after saying he wouldn't do the first strike, Trump then reversed himself.\n\"At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there,\" he said.\nCurrent Position: It's unclear where Trump stands on \"first use,\" or if he'd be willing to strike first.\nMINIMUM WAGE\n1. Against raising the minimum wage. Jobs would move to China.\nDuring the thick of the primaries, Trump repeatedly argued that raising the minimum would move jobs to countries like China. Speaking in the cold language of a businessman looking at his bottom line, Trump even seemed to indicate overall American wages, regardless of the law, were too generous already.\n\"Taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world,\" Trump said in a November debate hosted by Fox Business. Trump clarified afterwards that he did not believe American wages were too high, but he did make crystal clear he was fundamentally opposed to a minimum wage increase.\n2. Wages should be raised through economic growth.\nTrump in an interview with CNBC in May said he would prefer to try to raise wages through economic growth. His abrupt move toward a possible increase that he opposed in tough terms is a significant general election shift.\n3. Raise the minimum wage.\n\"I am looking at it, and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more,\" Trump said on ABC on May 8, acknowledging that his statement was a shift when pressed.\n\"Sure, it's a change. I'm allowed to change,\" he said. \"But my real minimum wage is going to be \u2014 I'm going to bring companies back into this country, and they're going to make a lot more than the $15 even.\"\n4. Get rid of the federal minimum wage, leave it to the states.\nOn NBC on the same day, Trump said more specifically that he wanted states to mandate wages.\n\"Let me just tell you, I've been traveling the country for many months. Since June 16, I'm all over,\" he said. \"I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour. Now, with that being said, I would like to see an increase of some magnitude. But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other.\"\n5. I want to increase it!\nIn a May 11 tweet criticizing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Trump argued that he was \"asking for increase\" of the federal minimum wage.\n6. States should change it, but it will hurt them.\n\"I actually think that the states should make the decision,\" Trump said in an interview with a Seattle radio station, but argued that \"In some cases, states are going to become noncompetitive, and they're going to start losing maybe jobs and losing business, and they're going to have to readjust. Otherwise, they're just not going to have anything.\"\n7. Let's make it $10 dollars an hour.\nAs the Washington Post notes, Trump's shift here are lengthy and significant: He says he would support raising it to $10 an hour, argues he never wanted to abolish the federal minimum wage, which he did.\n8. It should go up, but states should call the shots here.\nIn a June news conference, Trump said \"the minimum wage has to go up. People are \u2014 at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states \u2014 federal \u2014 I think that states should really call the shot.\"\nCurrent position: Raise it to $10 an hour, ignore what I said before.\n FROM MARCH 29: California is poised to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour 0:19 TAXES 1. The wealthy should pay more.\n\"I would take carried interest out, and I would let people making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they are paying very little tax and I think it's outrageous,\" Trump told Bloomberg last August, noting that he'd be OK paying more taxes. \"I want to lower taxes for the middle class.\"\n2. Cut taxes for the wealthy big time.\nIn September, Trump released a plan that silenced anti-tax critics with a proposal that slashed taxes for the wealthy by making the top marginal tax rate 25 percent. He radically simplified the tax plan by proposing just three brackets, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent. A whopping 67 percent of the overall cost of his individual tax cuts would go to the top 20 percent of earners, while 35 percent of it would go to the top 1 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center's analysis.\nHis plan is estimated to cut $10 trillion in tax revenue, which would be added to the national debt and deficit over a decade (more on Trump's flip-flopping position on paying off the national debt below). It's unclear how Trump would pay for such drastic cuts, but Trump insisted he could do it by offering the vague promise of striking better deals and cutting government waste.\n3. People like me should pay more.\nTrump was asked again in April during a \"TODAY\" town hall if he believed in raising taxes on the wealthy. Despite the big tax cuts for the wealthy outlined in his own tax plan, he said:\n\"I do, I do, including myself. I do.\"\nIn a series of interviews in early May, he claimed that his tax proposal was a starting point for negotiations and the taxes on the rich would go up.\nOn Sunday, May 8, Trump told ABC that taxes on the wealthy would \"go up a little bit\" in negotiations and that, as a wealthy person himself, he is personally OK with higher taxes. \"I am willing to pay more. And you know what? Wealthy are willing to pay more. We've had a very good run,\" he said.\nHe told NBC's Chuck Todd something similar: It's all negotiable.\n\"Under my proposal, it's the biggest tax cut by far, of any candidate by far. But I'm not under the illusion that that's going to pass. They're going to come to me. They're going to want to raise it for the rich. Frankly, they're going to want to raise it for the rich more than anybody else,\" Trump said. \"But the middle class has to be protected. The rich is probably going to end up paying more. And business might have to pay a little bit more. But we're giving a massive business tax cut.\"\nPressed on that last, confusing point - that business might pay more but also get a tax cut - Trump said he meant more than his existing proposal: \"Excuse me. I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal.\"\nHe didn't offer such a qualification for the wealthy until the next day.\n4. I never said that! Cut everyone's taxes!\nOn Monday, May 9, he went on CNN to refute what he'd said the day before.\n\"I said that I may have to increase on the wealthy \u2014 I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class \u2014 now, if I increase it on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they're paying now. I'm not increasing it from this point, I'm talking about increasing from my tax proposal,\" Trump told CNN, insisting that overall there would be a tax decrease for the rich and middle class alike.\n5. Maybe don't slash taxes by $10 trillion \u2014 slash taxes by $3 trillion, instead.\nTrump senior economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Wednesday at an RNC event that the tax plan had been revised to only slash taxes by $3 trillion \u2014 a third of what was initially proposed \u2014 and lower the top individual tax rate to between 30-33 percent, up from the 25 percent initially proposed but below the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent. The campaign did not confirm this.\n6. Scrap the earlier plan entirely. Here are new tax brackets.\nTrump took his earlier tax plan offline before a major economic policy address in early August, where he hiked his initially proposed tax brackets from 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent to 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. These brackets more closely mimic his party's past views on taxes.\n Trump Touts Childcare Deductions, Tax on U.S. Businesses Overseas 0:44 7. Maybe ditch, maybe keep a $1 trillion tax cut for small businesses (depending on who is asking).\nTrump publicly backed away from a trillion-dollar tax cut aimed at small businesses in order to optimistically claim that his tax plan won't add to the debt. But his campaign privately told a leading small business group he'd keep it.\nHis campaign then reiterated to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group that analyzes tax plans, that he'd definitely get rid of it, according to a report by the New York Times on what they called a \"trillion-dollar lie.\"\nCurrent position: Despite Trump's frequent talk about helping working people, his tax plan so far seems to mostly benefit the wealthy. It's unclear whether or not his plan will include that small business tax cut.\nVOTING FOR THE IRAQ WAR 1. Clinton voted for the war, so she has bad judgment.\nTrump slammed Clinton in late June for her vote authorizing the invasion of Iraq.\n\"It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started,\" he falsely stated in his June 22 speech . (There is no evidence he opposed the invasion, but there is ample evidence that he supported it.)\n2. It doesn't matter, people make mistakes.\nPressed on his running mate Pence's vote for the Iraq war in an interview on 60 Minutes, Trump said in July he didn't \"care\" because \"it's a long time ago, and he voted that way and they were also misled.\"\n\"He's entitled to make a mistake every once in a while,\" Trump declared, telling CBS' Lesley Stahl of Clinton that \"no, she's not\" allowed to make a mistake herself.\nCurrent position: It's OK that Trump's running mate voted for the Iraq war, but it's not OK that Clinton did.\n FROM JUNE 21: Clinton goes after Trump's economic plans 3:11 GUNS 1. Get rid of gun-free zones\nIn a speech at the National Rifle Association convention on May 20, where Trump was endorsed by the country's most powerful gun group, Trump promised again to do away with gun-free zones, which include schools and military bases. At a campaign stop in Vermont, he had previously vowed to get rid of gun-free zones on his \"first day.\"\n2. No guns in classrooms, except maybe some guns in classrooms.\nIn an interview on May 22, the presumptive nominee advocated against, and then for, and then against, and then for guns in classrooms.\n\"I don't want to have guns in classrooms, although in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms, frankly,\" Trump said, offering up two distinct views in an interview days after he was endorsed the NRA. \"Because teachers, you know \u2014 things that are going on in our schools are unbelievable.\"\n3. I'm not advocating for guns in classrooms, but wait, yes I am.\nTrump walked back his view that teachers should have guns a second later, then reiterated that some teachers should have guns.\n\"I'm not advocating guns in classrooms,\" he continued. \"But remember, in some cases \u2026 trained teachers should be able to have guns in classrooms.\"\n4. Let's put trained gunmen in schools.\nForty-eight hours later, Trump sought to clarify his muddled remarks, saying he wanted \"school resource officers\" to have guns in schools while slamming rival Hillary Clinton's criticism of his stance.\n\"The way she said it meant like every student should be sitting there carrying guns,\" Trump said on CNN on May 24 . \"If trained people had guns, you wouldn't have the carnage that you've had.\"\n5. We should only get rid of some gun-free zones.\nWhile he decried gun-free zones as \"offering up candy to bad people,\" he backed away from axing all of them, telling CNN in the May 24 interview that they would only be eliminated \"in some cases.\"\n6. More guns would save lives.\nTrump has repeatedly said that he wished there were other armed individuals present during terror attacks to fight back.\n\"I think it would've been a lot better if they had guns in that room, somebody could protect,\" Trump said after the San Bernardino shooting in December. \"They could've protected themselves if they had guns.\"\nIn the wake of the deadly shooting in Orlando, Florida at a gay nightclub in June, Trump reiterated this view.\n\"It's too bad that some of the young people that were killed over the weekend didn't have guns, you know, attached to their hips, frankly, and you know where bullets could have flown in the opposite direction,\" he said on the \"Howie Carr Show\" on June 13, one day after the attack. \"It would have been a much different deal. I mean, it sounded like there were no guns. They had a security guard. Other than that there were no guns in the room. Had people been able to fire back, it would have been a much different outcome.\"\n(Despite Trump's assertions, there was an armed guard at the club who tried to stop the gunman, but he was unable to do so.)\nAt a rally in Atlanta on June 15, Trump declared that the outcome would have been different if \"some of those great people that were in that club that night had guns strapped to their waist or strapped to their ankle.\"\n FROM JUNE 13: Donald Trump reacts to Orlando shooting: Criticizes Hillary Clinton, Obama 5:44 7. I didn't actually mean arming clubgoers.\nAfter he spent a week advocating for arming more of the victims (who were predominantly clubgoers, in addition to several club employees), Trump tweeted on June 20 that he didn't mean he wanted to arm clubgoers. Trump changed his stance just hours after the National Rifle Association pushed back against the idea of allowing people to bring weapons into nightclubs.\n\"I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees,\" Trump tweeted .\nCurrent position : More guns are better, though the details are murky and evolving on how many gun-free zones would be abolished.\n2011 INTERVENTION IN LIBYA 1. The intervention in Libya by the U.S.-led coalition was a terrible idea.\nAsked in October 2015 if he felt the Middle East would be more stable with Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi and Iraq's authoritarian leader Saddam Hussein still in power, Trump told NBC News' Chuck Todd, \"Of course it would be. You wouldn't have had your Benghazi situation, which is one thing which was just a terrible situation\u2026But of course, it would. Libya is \u2014 is not even \u2014 nobody even knows what's goin' on over there. It's not even a country anymore.\"\nA few weeks later, he was pressed again on CNN to say whether he felt the two leaders of brutal regimes should have been left in power.\n\"100 percent,\" Trump said. \"I mean, look at Libya. Look at Iraq. Iraq used to be no terrorists. [Hussein] would kill the terrorists immediately, which is like now it's the Harvard of terrorism.\"\nHe continued: \"If you look at Iraq from years ago, I'm not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy, but it was a lot better than it is right now. Right now, Iraq is a training ground for terrorists. Right now, Libya, nobody even knows Libya \u2014 frankly, there is no Iraq and there is no Libya. It's all broken up. They have no control. Nobody knows what's going on.\"\n2. I've never offered a different opinion on Libya.\nWhen then-rival Sen. Ted Cruz brought up Trump's 2011 support for the intervention, which Trump offered at the time via a video blog, during a February debate, Trump denied having ever supported Gadhafi's ouster.\n\"He said I was in favor in Libya,\" he said. \"I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi would be in charge right now.\"\n3. I guess I did support an intervention.\nWhen CBS actually played the video of Trump discussing the subject \u2014 and supporting an intervention \u2014 in front of Trump in early June 2016, the presumptive nominee changed his mind and acknowledged the past video.\n\"That's a big difference from what we're talking about,\" Trump said. \"I was for something, but I wasn't for what we have right now.\"\n4. I wanted a surgical intervention, not a \"strong\" intervention.\nWhen pressed during the CBS interview, Trump said he was for \"surgical\" intervention, not a \"strong intervention.\"\n\"I didn't mind surgical. And I said surgical. You do a surgical shot, and you take him out. But I wasn't for what happened. Look at the way - I mean, look at with Benghazi and with all of the problems that we've had. It was handled horribly,\" he said.\n\"I think since then you've said you were never for intervention, so it's confusing,\" CBS's John Dickerson countered.\n\"I was never for strong intervention. I could have seen surgical where you take out Gadhafi and his group,\" Trump responded.\n5. We really should have taken the oil in Libya, too, since we were there.\nIn the first debate, Trump inaccurately claimed ISIS now controls huge oil stores in Libya (they don't) and that the U.S. should have taken the oil after the intervention. (That would have violated the Geneva Conventions.)\nCurrent position: As Trump put it, \"I was for something, but I wasn't for what we have right now.\" That \"something\" seems to include violating the Geneva Conventions to seize Libyan oil.\nJAPAN AND NUKES 1. Japan should have nuclear weapons.\nIn March, Trump said the U.S. should reconsider its policy of not allowing Japan to have nuclear weapons. He reiterated that view in April.\n\"It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea,\" Trump said on Fox News in April .\nHost Chris Wallace followed up, asking, \"With nukes?\"\n\"Including with nukes, yes, including with nukes,\" Trump said.\n2. I never said that!\nBut at a Sacramento rally in June, Trump accused Clinton of lying when she repeated his view as an example of his unfitness when it comes to matters of national security.\nClinton \"made a speech, she's making another one tomorrow, and they sent me a copy of the speech. And it was such lies about my foreign policy, that they said I want Japan to get nuclear weapons. Give me a break,\" Trump said. \"See they don't say it: I want Japan and Germany and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and many of the NATO states, nations, they owe us tremendously, we're taking care of all those people and what I want them to do is pay up.\"\nCurrent position: It's unclear whether Trump would reverse U.S. policy to allow Japan to have nuclear weapons, but it's clear Trump doesn't like being reminded of the previous positions he took.\n FROM MAY 27: Former VP Mondale on Nuclear Dangers, Decision 2016 15:04 CLIMATE CHANGE 1. I don't believe in it.\n\"I don't believe in climate change,\" he told CNN in September after a long history of calling it both a hoax and a Chinese invention to undermine U.S. business interests. In May 2016, he vowed to \"renegotiate \u2026 at a minimum\" the Paris climate agreement, one of the Obama administration's landmark achievements.\n2. Global warming is threatening one of my golf courses.\nA statement of environmental impact filed by the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, owned by the presumptive Republican nominee, cited rising sea levels and extreme weather due to global warming as the reason the company needed to build a seawall to protect its coastal resort, Politico reported Monday. The sea wall is necessary protect the course from \"global warming and its effects.\"\n3. I never said climate change was a hoax.\nDuring the first presidential debate in late September, Trump denied ever saying climate change was a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese (though you can still read his tweet on the matter here.)\n4. Trump believes in climate change, but not that it's man-made.\nTrump's campaign manager offered a more common Republican theory to explain Trump's views: Climate change is real, but it's \"naturally occurring.\"\nCurrent position: Global warming is real, but it's not man-made.\nNATIONAL DEBT 1. Get rid of the national debt in 8 years.\nOn March 31, Trump told the Washington Post that the country needed to eliminate the national debt and that he could do it \"fairly quickly\" without raising taxes.\n\"I would say over a period of eight years,\" he said, arguing he could do it simply by renegotiating the country's trade deals. \"I'm renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we're doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We're losing with everybody.\"\n2. Only pay down a little. Invest in infrastructure first.\nThree weeks later, he told Fortune \"you could pay off a percentage of it\" in a decade but he wouldn't advise being too aggressive because the country's infrastructure needs to be rebuilt and it's a good time to borrow.\n\"It depends on how aggressive you want to be. I'd rather not be so aggressive,\" he said. \"Don't forget: We have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military, which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren't being done, amazingly.\"\nIt's an argument progressive liberal economists like Paul Krugman could have (and actually have) made . Not only is it far from his original position, it's far from his party's view on the issue.\n3. Pay off the debt by getting America's creditors to accept less.\nDespite the U.S. economy being fundamentally grounded in its ability to borrow at very low interest rates, Trump told CNBC that he would negotiate with creditors to get them to accept less than the full amount owed.\n\"I would borrow, knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal,\" Trump said.\nExperts say this idea is pure fantasy, no matter how good Trump's deal-making skills are. In addition to imperiling the economy, the proposal could also be unconstitutional.\n4. Don't worry about it \u2014 the U.S. can't default because we \"print the money.\"\nA week after suggesting that he could get U.S. creditors to accept less than the full amount, Trump defended his stance on CNN by calling himself \"the king of debt\" and railing against publications that reported his earlier proposal.\n\"People said I want to go and buy debt and default on debt, and I mean, these people are crazy. This is the United States government,\" he said on CNN on May 9.\" \"First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK?\"\nHe then advocated for buying back some of the government's debt at a discount, using interest rates to save the country money. It's a strategy that works may work for businesses but would be more difficult, if not impossible for the U.S. government, economists told the Washington Post.\n\"I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt \u2014 but you know, debt is tricky and it's dangerous, and you have to be careful and you have to know what you're doing,\" Trump said.\n5. I won't try to renegotiate the national debt.\n\"We have to start chopping that debt down,\" Trump told CBS in June. \"I wouldn't renegotiate the debt. I'd negotiate, if I do a deal in a corporation, as an example, and if the economy goes bad, I'll oftentimes renegotiate that debt. But that's a different thing. That's just a corporate thing. And other people like me, very big people in the world of business, they do that.\"\n6. Take out new loans and pay back debt with new debt.\n\"I think it could be a good time to borrow and pay off debt, borrow debt, make longer-term debt,\" he said in the same June CBS interview.\n7. My plans are deficit neutral.\n\"It will be deficit neutral,\" Trump said of his economic plan released in September. \"It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.\"\n8. Maybe borrow $10 trillion.\nOne of Trump's advisers echoed the skepticism many had of Trump's plans: that they would cost a lot more than Trump's tax plan would bring in.\nTom Barrack, an adviser, said Trump's policies would increase the national debt by $10 trillion \u2014 money the nation would have to borrow to accomplish Trump's plans.\nCurrent position: Either \"chop\" the national debt using an approach that is still unclear, or add $10 trillion to the debt to accomplish plans.\n FROM JUNE 21: U.S. 'doesn't do business Trump's way,' Clinton says 6:08 ABORTION 1. Criminalize women who have abortions.\nThough Trump said in 1999 that he was \"very pro-choice,\" Trump has consistently claimed that he's against abortion, except for in cases of rape, incest, or to save the mother's life, since starting his bid last June.\nBut during an exclusive interview with MSNBC's Chris Matthews just after 1 p.m., Trump struggled to define his views on abortion aside from describing himself as \"pro-life.\" When continually pressed for how he'd handle women who violated a theoretical ban on abortion, Trump said the \"answer is that there has to be some form of punishment, yeah.\"\n2. Let the states decide what to do about criminalizing abortion.\nAt 3:36 p.m., Trump put out a statement saying the issue is \"unclear and should be put back into the states for determination.\"\n3. Never mind. Don't punish the women.\nHe fully walked back his position that women should be punished for violating a theoretical abortion ban 80 minutes later, releasing a statement saying \"the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb.\"\n4. Probably overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states handle it.\nPressed three times in the final presidential debate on whether he hoped his anti-abortion Supreme Court nominees should overturn Roe v. Wade, Trump said \"that will happen automatically in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.\"\nHe went on to say that after it's overturned states should handle it: \"I will say this. It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination.\"\nCurrent position : Overturn Roe v. Wade, then let states decide it.\n FROM MARCH 30: Trump backs 'some form of punishment' for abortion 6:36 MONEY IN POLITICS 1. Accepting donations means a candidate is controlled by special interests.\nTrump announced that he'd self-fund his campaign when he announced his presidential bid. This, he said, time and time again would help him better serve the country against the corrupting force of money in politics.\n\"By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.!\" he wrote in a September 5 Facebook post.\n2. People can donate to me as long as they don't want anything in return.\nDespite the self-funding promise, the Trump campaign quietly sent out fundraising emails, put a glossy donate option on its website and raked in millions. Still, Trump insists, it's about investment in the campaign \u2014 not the cash itself.\n\"I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has to be no strings attached,\" he said in a CBS interview.\n3. The Trump campaign will not fully self-fund.\nAs the presumptive nominee, Trump has said he won't self-fund like he did in the primary.\n\"I'll be putting up money, but won't be completely self-funding,\" he told the Wall Street Journal in a May 4 interview , noting that he's created a finance committee and will tap his base for money going into the general election. He's hired Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner who has a history of political donations across both sides of the aisle, to head up the committee.\nThis is a reversal, but only in rhetorical terms, since Trump isn't exactly self-funding his primary campaign, despite his loud protestations to the contrary. PolitiFact dubs his claim \"half true\" because Trump is pulling in big bucks from donors and most of his own contributions are technically loans or in-kind contributions, signaling that he may want to recoup those costs eventually.\nCurrent position: Political donations are fine when those donations benefit the Trump campaign.\n FROM MARCH 29: The many flip-flops of Donald Trump 2:14 VIOLATING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS WITH REGARD TO TORTURE, TERRORISM 1. The military will obey potentially illegal orders.\nIn December, Trump started demanding that the US target the families of ISIS members in addition to \"bombing the sh*t\" out of the terrorist organization. He went further in February, advocating for torture as a method of interrogation.\n\"I would bring back waterboarding, and I'd bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding,\" Trump declared in the February debate just ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Calls for bringing torture back became a regular applause line at rallies, despite the likelihood that both of these ideas would require the American military to obey orders that violate international laws and federal anti-torture statutes.\nPressed at a debate on March 3 over whether the American military would obey his order to violate international laws and the Geneva Convention to do such things, Trump insisted they'd listen to him, despite condemnation from military leaders and conservatives.\n\"Frankly, when I say they'll do as I tell them, they'll do as I tell them,\" he said.\n2. The military shouldn't break the law, after all.\nHe then reversed this position the very next day, on March 4, in a statement to the Wall Street Journal, saying he \"will not order military or other officials to violate those laws and will seek their advice on such matters.\"\n3. The laws forbidding torture should be changed so no one has to break them.\nNot long after terrorist attacks in Brussels killed at least 28 people and injured dozens more on March 22, Trump called in to CNN to expand on his call to legalize waterboarding.\n\"Look, I think we have to change our law on the waterboarding thing, where they can chop off heads and drown people in cages, in heavy steel cages and we can't water board,\" Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"We have to change our laws and we have to be able to fight at least on almost equal basis.\"\nWhen Blitzer reminded Trump that military leaders don't support torture and that it violates international agreements that the United States has signed, Trump called opposition to torture a \"political decision.\"\n\"I would say that the eggheads that came up with this international law should turn on their television and watch CNN right now, because I'm looking at scenes on CNN right now as I'm speaking to you that are absolutely atrocious,\" Trump said. \"And I would be willing to bet, when I am seeing all of the bodies laying all over the floor, including young, beautiful children laying dead on the floor, I would say if they watched that, maybe, just maybe they'll approve of waterboarding and other things.\"\nCurrent position : Trump says he's against violating international laws or ordering others to do so, but wants to change the laws to legalize, at minimum, waterboarding.\n FROM MARCH 22: 'Waterboarding would be fine' for Paris terror suspect, Trump says 6:31 VISAS FOR HIGH-SKILLED WORKERS 1. H-1B visas are bad for American workers.\nTrump's immigration plan was published on his website in August 2015: it opposed the H-1B program, which allows non-immigrant visas for specialty occupations, arguing then that it was bad for American workers.\n2. H-1B visas are good.\nAt the CNBC debate in October, Trump denied that he'd been critical about the program. \"I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley,\" he said.\n3. H-1B visas are still bad, according to Trump's unchanged website.\nAt the Fox News debate on March 3, some five months later, Fox News host Megyn Kelly pressed Trump on which of these conflicting views he supports.\n4. H-1B visas are necessary: 'I'm changing.'\n\"I'm changing. I'm changing. We need highly skilled people in this country. If we can't do it, we will get them in. And we do need in Silicon Valley, we absolutely have to have. So we do need highly skilled,\" he said.\n5. H-1B visas are definitely bad.\nHis campaign later released a statement reversing this shortly after the March 3 debate ended.\n\"Megyn Kelly asked about highly skilled immigration. The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: These are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay,\" Trump wrote in a statement. \"I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\"\nHe reaffirmed this position in the GOP debate on March 10 , one week later, vowing to end the program that he noted he uses himself as a businessman.\nCurrent position: Back where he started \u2014 against the H-1B visa program.\n FROM JULY 12, 2015: A Look at Donald Trump's Evolving Positions Over the Years 3:58 BORDER CONTROL AND THE REFUGEE CRISIS 1. The U.S. has a 'humanitarian' obligation to take in some Syrian refugees.\nTrump initially said the country should absorb Syrian refugees.\n\"I hate the concept of it, but on a humanitarian basis, you have to,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly on Fox News on a Tuesday night in September. \"But you know, it's living in hell in Syria. There's no question about it. They're living in hell, and something has to be done.\"\n2. The U.S. cannot and should not accept Syrian refugees.\nThe next day, Trump said the country couldn't welcome refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war.\n\"Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help. But we have our own problems,\" he said on Fox.\nDuring the March debate, Trump defended his changing view.\n\"First time the question had been put to me, it was very early on. The migration had just started. And I had heard that the number was a very, very small number. By the second day, two or three days later, I heard the number was going to be thousands and thousands of people. You know, when they originally heard about it, they were talking about bringing very, very small numbers in, and I said, begrudgingly, well, I guess maybe that's OK,\" Trump said. \"By the time I went back and studied it, and they were talking about bringing thousands and thousands, I changed my tune. And I don't think there's anything wrong with that.\"\n3. Close the border.\n\"I'd close up our borders to people until we figure out what is going on,\" Trump said on Fox News the morning of the Brussels attacks claimed by ISIS that killed at least 28 and injured more than 270.\n4. Don't close the border, just be careful.\n\"I didn't say shut it down \u2014 I said you have to be very careful, you have to be careful on who's coming into our country,\" he said the same day as the Fox News interview on CBSN, reiterating that people from Syria without papers shouldn't be allowed in.\nCurrent position : Against closing the borders entirely. Against accepting Syrian refugees in the United States.\nKU KLUX KLAN AND DAVID DUKE 1. 'I disavow, OK?'\nAfter former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard and white nationalist David Duke began encouraging his followers to vote for the Republican front-runner, including making a plea on his radio show on February 25, Trump initially disavowed Duke's support in a press conference on February 26.\n\"I didn't even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? OK, all right. I disavow, OK?\" Trump said.\n2. 'I don't know anything about David Duke. OK?'\nAfter disavowing David Duke on a Friday, Trump was asked about the Ku Klux Klan and Duke by CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. Trump claimed to know nothing of Duke or the KKK.\n\"I don't know anything about David Duke. OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me or what's going on, because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about,\" Trump said, refusing three times to unequivocally condemn the support of white supremacists until he knew more about them.\n3. 'I disavow, OK?' \u2014 part two.\nAfter that cagey song and dance-like interview sparked outrage, Trump took to Twitter to clarify, tweeting a video of his Friday press conference in which he did disavow Duke.\nAs I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow. pic.twitter.com/OIXFKPUlz2\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2016 The next day on NBC's \"Today,\" Trump blamed his refusal to condemn Duke and the KKK on a lousy earpiece but continued to hedge against disavowing the support of \"groups\" he doesn't know anything about, despite Savannah Guthrie's reminder that in the interview in question, Trump had been only been asked about the KKK and Duke.\nCurrent position : Trump has disavowed Duke, despite a lengthy back-and-forth about whether he knows about him or not.\nTHE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL 1. Keep the current deal with Iran, police it.\nTrump was one of the few Republicans who didn't immediately promise to rip up the Iranian nuclear deal. The author of \"The Art of the Deal\" told his supporters that while it was the worst deal ever, they'd probably have to live with it.\n\"It's very hard to say, \"We're ripping it up.' And the problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion,\" Trump said, referring to a high estimate of how many of Iran's assets will be unfrozen as part of the deal (the White House says after Iran's debts are paid, it's closer to $56 billion).\n\"But I will police that deal,\" he said, touting his handling of business contracts. \"I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.\"\n2. Renegotiate the nuclear deal with Iran.\nIn September, he went further.\n\"When I am elected president, I will renegotiate with Iran \u2014 right after I enable the immediate release of our American prisoners and ask Congress to impose new sanctions that stop Iran from having the ability to sponsor terrorism around the world,\" he wrote in an op-od for USA Today.\nCurrent position : Renegotiate the deal.\n These are the blue states Donald Trump needs to flip red to win 2:29 HEALTH CARE 1. Repeal Obamacare. Look to Canada for inspiration.\nIn August, Trump was asked repeatedly if he still supported the single-payer health care he'd touted in the past. He said America should have a private system but repeatedly praised Canada and Scotland's socialized system.\n\"As far as single-payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here,\" Trump said. \"What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state \u2026 Get rid of the artificial lines, and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\"\n2. Repeal Obamacare. Cover everybody.\n\"I am going to take care of everybody,\" Trump told CBS in September. \"I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.\"\n3. Repeal Obamacare, but 'I like the mandate'\nDuring a CNN town hall on February 18, Trump started to answer a question about how he'd replace the Affordable Care Act with health savings accounts, \"which are great,\" but interrupted himself to talk at length about how he's \"a self-funder.\" When pressed by interviewer Anderson Cooper about what would happen when Obamacare is repealed and the mandate disappeared, therefore allowing insurance companies to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, Trump said:\n\"Well, I like the mandate. OK. So here's where I'm a little bit different. I don't want people dying on the streets and I say this all the time.\"\n4. Repeal Obamacare. Replace it with something.\nTrump was mocked in the February 25 debate for being vague about how he would replace Obamacare.\n\"You'll have many different plans. You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans,\" he said at the debate, earning derision from Sen. Marco Rubio.\n5. Repeal Obamacare. Not everyone will be covered.\nHis health care plan, finally released online in March, has far more in common with the kind of boilerplate health care proposals the rest of the Republican party touts than his earlier praise for Canada suggested it might.\nIt would likely cause 21 million people to lose their health insurance and cost about $270 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan budget advocacy group Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB).\nIt offers up unspecified amounts of grants to states to replace Medicaid, but it's not clear how or what those would look like, or how they would cover the millions of people that Trump's plan lets fall through the cracks. CRFB noted that block grants \"could generate a wide range of savings\" to the federal budget, but without details on them, it is \"impossible to score any savings\" from his plan.\nCurrent position : Repeal Obamacare.

Without giving a timetable for the consultation, Rudd said she wanted to \"flush out\" businesses that looked abroad rather than employing or training British workers. Amber Rudd delivers her speech to at the conference of Britain's Conservative Party.

O'Brien read out what he said was a line from Rudd's conference speech before revealing it was in fact a passage by Hitler. \nRudd defended her plans Wednesday. \"We should be able to have a conversation about immigration,\" she told the BBC. \"If we do talk about immigration, don't call me a racist.\" Alexander Smith ", "Oct 12 2016, 6:09 pm ET Street Photographer Captures Mexico's Complexity Over 30 Years by Natalia Jimenez \nAlex Webb's vibrant Mexican street scenes, taken over three decades, are published in his new book \"Alex Webb: La Calle.\" 12 Photos Comment 1. \n\"The truth is that the history of Mexico is a history in the image of its geography: abrupt and tortuous. Each historical period is like a plateau surrounded by tall mountains and separated from the other plateaus by precipices and divides.\" \u2014 Octavio Paz \nThroughout Mexico, life spills onto the streets, as sidewalks and avenues become a place to gather, learn or entertain. Alex Webb was first drawn to the richness and complexity that plays out in the country's \"calles,\" or streets, over three decades ago. \n\"I was startled and fascinated by this country, so close to the United States and yet so far culturally,\" Webb, who grew up in New England, told NBC News. \"I was intrigued by the vibrancy \u2014 the sense of energy \u2014 of life on the street in Mexico.\" \nAfter early visits to border towns where the influence of American culture was unavoidable, Webb continued to return, each time venturing deeper into the country and always letting his curiosity guide his camera. \n\"Between 1975 and 2007, I photographed in Mexico more consistently than any other place in the world,\" he said. \nThe increasing violence Mexico has recently faced from the drug cartels prompted Webb to revisit his work in the country. \n\"Though the Mexico that I have experienced over the years has sometimes had a violent edge, the level of brutality \u2014 beheadings, bodies hung from road overpasses \u2014in the current drug wars seems alien to the world of Mexico that I encountered when I first started making trips to Oaxaca in the early 1980s,\" he said. \nWebb's visual explorations from his time in Mexico come together in \"La Calle,\" published this fall by Aperture. Essays by Mexican authors accompany Webb's images, articulating what the country's streets mean to them. Together they create a glimpse of a country fighting to balance its rich history with a modern culture. \nThe allure of Mexico's culture may never fade for Webb, despite fewer recent visits. \n\"Interestingly enough, now that I am trying to photograph more in the United States, I find myself drawn to the vibrant street life in Mexican communities in such disparate places as Indianapolis and Brooklyn.\" \nAbove: Le\u00f3n, Guanajuato, 1987 ", "advertisement \nJanet Basilan found herself on a plane to the United States in January 2009, reluctant to leave her son and husband behind in the Philippines, but eager, like the six other teachers on her flight, to begin working in the American public education system so that she could send money back home. Basilan told NBC News the person who recruited her had promised she would earn five times the amount she currently made as a high school science teacher in the Philippines. All she had to do was pay travel and settlement fees. \nBasilan said she borrowed close to $18,000 in loans from her bank and several loan sharks, certain she'd be able to pay everything back with her new job. But instead of going to work, Basilan spent two months confined to a house in Maryland with more than 20 other teachers before learning that there weren't any jobs waiting for them. \nThere never were, she said. Post by NBC News . \nBasilan's story is one of many similar stories documented by GABRIELA USA, the U.S.-based chapter of a grassroots association comprised of over 200 organizations fighting for the freedom of oppressed Filipino women. Named for the female Filipino revolutionary leader Gabriela Silang, GABRIELA USA campaigns on issues including gender discrimination, violence against women, women's reproductive rights, and human trafficking \u2014 which has become a growing concern for GABRIELA USA, especially as the organization began receiving calls for help from victimized teachers like Basilan. \n\"When we found out about these teachers who were tricked, it became a campaign to find others, and we were able to hold a press conference,\" Irma Salvatierra Bajar, GABRIELA USA chairperson, told NBC News. \"Then we started getting phone calls from D.C. and San Jose with women saying, 'I worked for the same recruiter. This happened to me too.'\" \"I've grown from a fearful victim to a strong survivor, whose aim right now is to help others who have been in the same situation as me.\" \nGABRIELA USA discovered that between 2009 to 2014, and operating under the guise of a recruiter for various employment agencies, Isidro Rodriguez lured more than 300 teachers, including Basilan, from the Philippines to the United States with promises of H-1B non-immigrant visas, full-time teaching jobs, and provided housing. \nInstead, Basilan alleged that he placed the teachers in cramped living quarters, confiscated their cell phones to cut them off from their families, set them up with sham job interviews, and failed to facilitate the processing of their visas, all while continuing to extract fees from their pockets. Like many others, Basilan was undocumented, unemployed, and over $30,000 in debt to the loan sharks who had already begun charging interest rates. \n\"I was forced to accept any job: cleaning the house, working as a dishwasher in a restaurant,\" Basilan told NBC News. \"I was forced to work from dawn to dusk just to get the money I needed to pay for my loans back home, because my family was being threatened by loan sharks to be sued and imprisoned. I don't ever want to go back to that time.\" \nWorking alongside organizations like BAYAN USA, Migrante International, and the National Alliance for Filipino Concerns (NAFCON), GABRIELA USA officially launched the Justice for Filipino Trafficked Teachers campaign in December 2014, and has worked since then to pursue justice for the women targeted by Rodriguez, who is reportedly still at large . The campaign has also helped trafficked teachers obtain T visas \u2014 which allows trafficked immigrants to stay in the United States if they comply in cases involving their traffickers \u2014 as well as protest the Philippine Labor Migration Policy of the Philippine government, which allows and encourages emigration. \n\"GABRIELA USA was the group to educate us on our rights,\" said Basilian, who formed GABRIELA USA's DC chapter in 2013 with other trafficked teachers.

The petition received over 10,000 signatures in less than 24 hours. \nNBC Entertainment executives clarified in a statement following the backlash that, while the script had been purchased, there would be no plans to develop a show. \n\"We purchased the pitch with the understanding that it would tell the creator's real-life experience of being raised by a strong Filipina stepmother after the loss of her own mother,\" an NBC spokesperson told NBC News in a statement last month . \"The writer and producers have taken the sensitivity to the initial concept to heart and have chosen not to move forward with the project at this time.\" \nBajar said it was important for advocates to speak up against the possibility of lighthearted portrayals of such a serious issue. \"The idea is to not normalize US imperialism to the Filipino and American communities \u2014 to say that this is okay,\" she said. \"Women aren't getting married because they want to; no woman wants to be away from their families. But it's a job, and the Philippines doesn't have a lot of those, so they leave.\" Post by NBC News . \nLike many trafficked Filipino women, Basilan hasn't been back to the Philippines since leaving in 2009, although she was able to sponsor her son to come to the U.S. and is currently working on bringing her husband soon. She's now GABRIELA USA's vice chair and works as a pre-K teacher at a community-based organization in D.C. \nBasilan said she's still paying off the loans she took out to pay Rodriguez. \n\"I've grown from a fearful victim to a strong survivor, whose aim right now is to help others who have been in the same situation as me,\" Basilan said. \"I want to provide education and awareness to the situation of those being trafficked.

Timm Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to speak to a campaign rally, Thursday, Oct. 27, 2016, in Geneva, Ohio. Evan Vucci / AP Share advertisement \nFrom extreme Obamacare tax hikes to allegations of widespread corruption by Hillary Clinton and her allies, Donald Trump's Thursday night speeches and a Fox News interview offered up more than a dozen inaccuracies \u2014 an impressive feat even for a campaign that has spawned an cottage industry of fact checkers. \nHere's what he got wrong. \n1. \"The Clinton crew gave more than $675,000 to the deputy FBI director overseeing the investigation into Hillary's illegal server,\" Trump said in Toledo, Ohio. \nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's political arms gave that sum to a Virginia political candidate whose husband is an FBI official, but he wasn't promoted to oversee the Clinton email case until after that Virginia legislative race was already over. McAuliffe is a Clinton ally, to be sure, but not a member or part of any Clinton organization or \"crew.\" \n2. Trump said in two cities that 75 percent of people thing the country is on the wrong track. \nThat figure is actually 65 percent. \n3. Trump said Arizonans will see an \"116 percent hike.\" \nArizona will be hard hit by Obamacare rate hikes, and this figure is true for some plans, but Obamacare administrators say lower income Americans will be shielded from that hike by government subsidies designed to make healthcare more affordable. Middle income Americans may not be shielded from the hike as much, though. \n4. \"Remember every time you see a closed factory, a wiped-out community here in Ohio, the Clintons were really involved because NAFTA was such a disaster. And he signed it.\" \nPresident George H.W. Bush negotiated and signed NAFTA and former President Bill Clinton advocated for its Congressional approval. Clinton was hardly the only one and the deal's flaws can hardly be pinned on him and his wife: More Republicans than Democrats voted for the trade deal. One of Trump's top allies, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, was a key player in securing Congressional approval. \n5. \"Hillary Clinton put the office of Secretary of State up for sale.\" \nThere's no evidence that Clinton illegally used her influence as Secretary of State for her financial gain. \n6. \"Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes on small businesses up to 45 percent. What a difference this is. I was just thinking to myself: We should just cancel the election and give it to Trump.\" \nThat would be a coup, and Clinton doesn't want to tax small businesses 45 percent. She wants to raise taxes on wealthy people, so the increase Trump appears to be referring to would only apply to people reporting an income over 5 million. If a private business owner were reporting their business' income on their personal taxes and it was over $5 million - which is about 0.02 percent of tax returns - such a tax hike could occur. \n7. \"Hillary also says she wants to put coal miners out of work.\" \nThose remarks are out of context. She was talking about helping people who are losing their job in the coal industry. \n8. Clinton wants to \"stop producing shale energy in most places and put a permanent moratorium on energy development on federal lands where vast coal and shale energies are located.\" \nPolitiFact found that Clinton has supported regulations on shale energy , not ending it. She has advocated for a three-year moratorium on energy development, not a permanent ban, as well as increasing renewable energy production on those federal lands. \n9. Trump said Obama golfs every other day. \nHe doesn't. Obama completed his 300th round of golf in August, which if averaged out would be a round of golf every nine days. He's likely to play more in the summer and less in the winter months. \n10. ISIS is dreaming of her becoming president.\" \n12. \"The Border Patrol Agents and ICE, both endorsed me.\" \nThey did not; federal agencies cannot get involved in elections. Unions representing some of their employees did. \n13. Trump pronounced the Ohio city Lima as \"Lee-ma\" while speaking in Toledo. \nHis crowd corrected him: It's pronounced Ly-ma, as in lima beans. \n14. \"She pledges open border in secret to her donors, even as it costs millions of dollars and thousands of American lives,\" Trump said in Geneva. \nShe spoke positively about the concept of open borders as it related to energy in a speech excerpt in a batch of emails that appear to have been hacked from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta and released by WikiLeaks. While we only see an excerpt of the speech in the emails, she was not pledging to an actual immigration or national security policy. \n15. Trump said on Fox News that Pew Research found millions of registered voters who are dead or registered in multiple states, arguing that \"that means you vote in two states.\" \nPew Research found outdated and inaccurate information on voter rolls, but it did not find evidence of voter fraud. A Loyola University study of one billion ballots found 31 credible instances of voter fraud. \n16. Trump said that the Clintons became wealthy after leaving the White House by selling \"favors\" and \"access.\" The Clintons became wealthy writing books and giving paid speeches , a common way for political figures to grow their wealth after leaving office. \n17.

Lindsey Graham a \"bro with no ho\" and critically referred to President Barack Obama as the \"drug dealer in chief\" for his handling of Iran -- the senator has worked hard to distance his campaign from Trump. \nAfter endorsing him early on, Kirk became the first Republican senator to un-endorse Trump back in June amid the nominee's early headline-dominating controversies. Kirk later called him \"too bigoted and racist\" to be president and ran ads against his party's nominee, saying in Spanish \"I do not support Trump\" in short television spots airing on Telemundo and Hispanic this fall. \nRunning in a blue state, Kirk had little choice: the state hasn't gone red in a presidential election since 1988 and in the few polls conducted in the state Clinton is polling in double digits ahead of Trump. \nThe embattled senator championed his own tough recovery from a stroke that nearly killed him as a learning experience and sought to differentiate himself as more moderate than his controversial national nominee, arguing instead that Trump's candidacy helped him remind his blue state of his independent streak, and votes gun restrictions and support of gay rights. \nAs his electoral hopes and Trump's numbers dropped throughout the summer and fall, Kirk was one of the most outspoken Republicans insisting that Trump should be pulled from the ballot, despite the fact that voting had already begun and there was no way to remove him. \nIn the end, Kirk will end his bid just as he began it: tied to Trump.

Reyes In this June 20, 2016, photo, The Supreme Court is seen in Washington. The eight-justice court has eight cases to resolve in the waning days of a trying and mournful term since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February. Alex Brandon / AP Share advertisement \nDid you know that the nation's first successful school desegregation case centered on a blond Mexican-American fifth-grader? Or that a 9-year-old Latina helped pave the way for the end of school segregation in the United States? \nLatinos have long been at the forefront of the battle to improve education outcomes for all Americans. But unlike many of the struggles of the African-American civil rights movement, these efforts are largely unknown to most people today. In fact, as far back as the 1930s, Latinos have been organizing and mounting legal challenges to what they considered unjust education policies. \nIn cases dealing with everything from the \"separate but equal\" doctrine to bilingual education to college access, the Latino community has a rich legacy of parents fighting for better schools, better communities, and better futures for their children. \nHere's a look at six key cases where Latinos helped shape education policy. Roberto Alvarez v. Lemon Grove School District (California, 1931) \nLemon Grove was a small district outside San Diego, where Mexican-American and white students attended school together. One day, the principal blocked the door and turned away the Mexican-American kids. He told them that henceforth they would be studying in a rundown building the kids called la caballeriza (\"the stable\"). \nAlthough the district maintained that this was necessary because the Mexican-American students couldn't speak English and had assimilation issues, it was really more of a reflection of the anti-immigrant sentiments of the Depression era. In fact, many of the Mexican-American children had been born and raised in California. \nSo the Lemon Grove parents banded together and sued the district. Their plaintiff was Roberto Alvarez, age 12, chosen because of his fair appearance, excellent grades, and perfect English. Roberto Alvarez (right) and Roberto Alvarez Jr., at the School of American Research, New Mexico 1996. Roberto Alvarez Jr. \nA California Superior Court judge ruled that segregating the Mexican-American students infringed on the laws of the state, and soon all the kids were back attending school together. \nWhile it attracted little notice at the time, the Lemon Grove parents had won the first successful school desegregation case in American history. \nRoberto Alvarez Jr., now professor emeritus at the University of California San Diego, only learned about the case when he was doing research as a graduate student at Stanford. \"My dad, and his parents, were really humble about it,\" he told NBC News. \"People in the family called it, 'that court thing;' to them it was something that came and went. Later, we called it the 'Lemon Grove Incident .'\" \n\"My dad was very old-school; I don't think he realized the broader significance and impact of what he had done,\" Alvarez said. \nOne thing is certain: The senior Alvarez made the most of his education. When he passed away at age 84 in 2003 , the Los Angeles Times described him as a successful businessman \"who made millions.\" Mendez v. Westminster School District (California, 1946) \nSylvia Mendez was nine years old when her parents took her to register for school in Orange County, California. Instead they were turned away, and told to go to the \"Mexican school,\" even though her family spoke more English than Spanish. Sylvia Mendez, age 10, the plaintiff in Mendez v. Westminster case. Sylvia Mendez \nMendez' father recruited other families for a class action lawsuit and they sued the district over the policy of \"separate but equal\" schools for Mexican-Americans and white students. Mendez' lawyer argued that segregating Mexican-American students led to feelings of inferiority among them, and a federal judge agreed. The ruling was upheld on appeal, and later California's Governor Earl Warren decided to end segregation in all of the state's public schools. \"We have to reframe history so people see how committed Latinos parents are to their youth. We are not powerless.\"- policy expert Deborah Santiago \nMendez returned to school - but she had changed history . One of the lawyers who submitted a brief in support of her case was Thurgood Marshall, who used the legal framework from Mendez to argue Brown v. Board of Education at the Supreme Court in 1954. \nBy then, the Chief Justice was Earl Warren, who sided with Marshall and wrote the majority opinion ending segregation in public schools. So the Mendez case can be seen as a roadmap for Brown; it laid the legal groundwork for one of the significant court decisions in American history. Sylvia Mendez receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She is an advocate for Latino educational issues. Sylvia Mendez. \nSylvia Mendez, now retired from a 33-year career in nursing, recalled how the case impacted her personally. \"When I went back to school, I felt pressure to do well, because my parents had fought for me to be there,\" she told NBC News. \"They taught me that, no matter what, you have to persevere.\" \nMendez received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. \"I cried when President Obama put it around my neck, thinking of my parents,\" she said. \"I felt like they were finally getting the recognition they deserved. I am just like the messenger, telling the story; they really did all the work.\" Aspira v. Board of Education of the City of New York (New York, 1972) \nAspira, a community organization , sued New York City's Board of Education over the right of students with limited English proficiency to receive bilingual education. Aspira charged that the New York City schools were denying educational opportunities to Puerto Rican students with little or no English-language ability. \nBacked by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund , Aspira won a settlement from the city guaranteeing bilingual education for all New York City public school students. This case was important because it was settled in the largest school district in the country, and it led to bilingual education being introduced in other districts as well. Deborah Santiago, Chief Operating Officer and Vice President for Policy, Excelencia in Education. Rodney Choice / Rodney Choice/www.choicephotogra \n\"The Aspira case has since benefited Asian-Americans, African-Americans, refugees, people of all backgrounds. And the bigger picture is that it was Latinos, in this case Puerto Ricans, who took leadership in moving the issue forward,\" said Deborah Santiago, Chief Operating Officer for Excelencia in Education . \"We have to reframe history so people see how committed Latinos parents are to their youth. We are not powerless.\" \nSantiago believes that the perception that Latinos do not value education must be challenged. \"We can see from history that this is not true,\" she noted. \"In case after case, Latinos are fighting for rights that benefit everyone, so that everyone can get the equity and support that Latino parents felt their children deserved.\" \n\"We are not just fighting for our own rights,\" Santiago said. \"Latinos are advocating in ways that put their own name and experience on the line so that other families can benefit.\" Serna v. Portales Municipal School District (New Mexico, 1974) \nWhen Judy Serna was ready for first grade, her mother took her to enroll in school. The school refused to admit her, however, because they said she couldn't speak English. Serna's mother and other parents joined a lawsuit against the school district. JUDY SERNA as a child, plaintiff in the lawsuit Serna v. Portales School District, 1974. Judy Serna \nIn court, they pointed out that minority children made up over half of the students in New Mexico's public schools, and charged that the district's failure to provide them with a bilingual education was a violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Both a federal court and a circuit court found in favor of Serna, and the district was ordered to come up with programs that could meet the needs of all students. \nRELATED: Public Schools Becoming More Racially Segregated: Report \nThe Serna case helped make education equal for Latinos and Spanish-surnamed students across New Mexico, and strengthened the right of English-language learners to an education tailored to their needs. \nLooking back, Judy Serna recalled her memories of the case for NBC News. \"It wasn't even true that I didn't speak English. As a kid, I was comfortable in Spanish because I spent a lot of time with my grandparents, but mostly I was just shy,\" she remembered. \"What is amazing to me is that my mother, a single mom, would take on the school district and actually win.\" \nRELATED: Color Barrier: Segregation Images Resonate 60 Years On \nSerna missed out on a year of school while the case was being resolved , but she says it was worth it. \"I am proud of what my mom achieved,\" she said. \"She made things better for other students, and it also led to the hiring of bilingual teachers. So because of her, more Latino teachers were hired.\" \nAnd ironically, Serna knows more than ever about the value of being fully bilingual. \"All my life,\" she reflected, \"speaking Spanish has helped me get jobs.\" Plyler v. Doe (Texas, 1982) \nIn the 1970s, Texas passed a law that stripped funding from school districts that educated undocumented children, and authorized school districts to charge tuition to the parents of those children. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) filed suit on behalf of a group of these children to have the law invalidated. \nThe case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1982 struck down the Texas law. \"If the state is to deny a discrete group of innocent children the free public education that it offers to other children residing within its borders, that denial must be justified by a showing that it furthers some substantial state interest,\" wrote Justice William Brennan in the majority opinion. \"No such showing was made here.\" \nThe idea of public education for all children may seem like a non-issue now, yet it was far from settled before Plyler. When the case was initially heard in Texas, the undocumented children involved took all of their belongings with them in suitcases to the courthouse - because they had been told that they would be deported immediately if their side lost. \nSince then, Plyler's doctrine has been used to strike down or weaken other discriminatory measures, like California's Proposition 187 . Thomas A. Saenz, President and General Counsel, MALDEF. Roberto Flores \nThomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, said he is not surprised that cases like Plyler are not better known. \n\"The narrative of civil rights in this country has been largely framed through a Black/white/Southern U.S. paradigm,\" said Saenz. \"Not as much attention has been paid to the discrimination against Latinos in the Southwest and West.\" \nPart of the challenge for Latino civil rights advocates, he said, is adapting laws that were developed in a Black/White construct to protect Latino communities. Civil rights laws were typically written to end racial discrimination, while Latinos can face discrimination based on language ability, accents, or immigration status. \nCases like Plyler, Saenz said, stem from efforts by politicians to exploit fear among certain Americans of the growth of the Hispanic population. School policy is a natural place to attempt to exploit such a fear, he noted, because that is where the demographic trends are most visible. \n\"But if you read Plyler, it still holds up,\" he said. \"The justices split 5-4, but all nine justices believed it was bad policy to exclude undocumented children from our public schools.\" LULAC v. Richards (Texas, 1987) \nAt the time of this lawsuit, 20 percent of Texas residents lived in the state's border areas, but only 10 percent of state funding for public universities went there. \"People complained that they couldn't go to a good school near where they lived,\" said Albert Kauffman of St. Mary's University School of Law, one of the attorneys for MALDEF in the case. \"People were saying, why are our universities second-rate?\" St Mary's University School of Law Professor Albert Kauffman speaks at MALDEF banquet, 2013. Albert Kauffman \nThe suit alleged that Texas did not provide equal higher education opportunities in predominantly Hispanic border cities like El Paso and Laredo, compared to cities in the state's interior. At the trial, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) showed that, on average, students in the border areas travelled 225 miles to attend a comprehensive university - one with doctoral programs and professional schools - while those in the rest of Texas traveled 45 miles. \n\"It was the result of both neglect and discrimination, and because folks in the border areas did not have political clout,\" Kauffman said. \"People in the capital said that these students were 'not ready,' or they only needed access to a Bachelors Degree and that was enough.\" \nRELATED: 2016 Latino State of the Union: What Affects Latinos Today \nThe trial court ruled in favor of LULAC , and the South Texas/Border Initiative was created to improve funding in the region. By the time this decision was overturned in 1993, the Initiative had already become a catalyst for more state money, new degree programs, and new campuses in the border areas. The El Paso Times has noted that the lawsuit changed the trajectory of the University of Texas El Paso, whose student body is 80 percent Hispanic . \n\"It took a lawsuit to break up the old system and give people in that region a chance,\" Kauffman said. \"It also took political leaders coming together and putting aside differences, and coming up with a plan. If it hadn't been for that, there would not be the opportunities we have now. Because of that, there is a much better higher education system throughout the border area.\" \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Raul A.

The email remained classified, despite Kennedy's disagreement on its classification. What's more: Kennedy did not propose the quid pro quo; the FBI agent did. Kennedy's agency later ordered a review of his conduct. \nThe episode appears to have been borne from a misunderstanding and muddled conversations, NBC News reported Monday. \n\"The FBI confirmed today that the State Department and senior State Department officials offered a quid pro quo to the FBI to cover up classified documents that were on Hillary Clinton's private server,\" Gov. Mike Pence said on Monday. \"According to documents, listen up on this, folks, this is real. According to documents released by the FBI today, one of Hillary Clinton's top, top aides, Under Secretary of State, contacted the FBI to ask the FBI to change the classified status of emails on Hillary Clinton's private server in exchange for a quid pro quo,\" \nThe FBI denied the allegation.

Trump Misleads On Clinton's Support From Women \nDonald Trump tweeted Sunday that Hillary Clinton was down 11 points with women. \n\"Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!\" he wrote. \nHowever, a closer look at the poll results indicate that Trump is misinterpreting Clinton's support among female voters. \nIn the ABC News/Washington Post poll that Trump referenced, Clinton actually leads by 8 points among women. She and Trump now run evenly among men, an unanticipated shift from polls taken at the end of September when Clinton had a 19-point advantage with women and Trump had a 19-point lead with men. The latest poll indicates that Trump has gained among white women without college degrees while Clinton has made inroads with white men. \nA new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted entirely after the second presidential debate shows an even starker gender gap. Its findings indicate that Clinton holds a 20-point lead among female voters in a two-way race, 55 percent to 35 percent. Trump is ahead among men by only three points, 48 percent to 45 percent. Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43! 2 days ago Fact Check: No, Obama Isn't Flooding Streets with Drug Kingpins \n\"President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals. Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels,\" Donald Trump said on Saturday according to prepared remarks for his Portsmouth, New Hampshire speech. \nPresident Obama is not flooding the streets with drug kingpins, as Donald Trump alleges, and Hillary Clinton has not voiced support for doing anything similar. \nThe president has commuted the sentences of a record number of nonviolent drug offenders, like a 25-year-old convicted of selling LSD while following the Grateful Dead on tour and sentenced to life in prison. He will now be released in 2018. The commutations are designed to combat long, draconian, drug sentencing. \nSome with longer criminal records have benefited from Obama's policy, like one Miami dealer who oversaw several drug dealers and had weapons charges on this record. His sentence was reduced from life in prison to 30 years; he'll be released sometime after 2035. The White House says all applicants for commutation are evaluated \"to determine that an applicant is ready to make use of his or her second chance.\" \nLast year, the federal government \u2014 prompted not by Obama but an independent body that unanimously approved lowering sentencing charges \u2014 also released 6,000 prisoners convicted of drug-related charges released early after being deemed not to be a threat to society by judges. That's not tens of thousands, as Trump alleges, but the administration did say as many as 40,000 could become eligible for similar early release programs in the coming years. \nAs for his suggestion that these are \"illegal immigrants\" with cartel ties? All non-U.S. citizens (roughly one in three) face deportation or deportation hearings. 3 days ago Trump Ditched the Teleprompters \u2014 Here Are 6 Facts He Blurred \n1. \"Crooked Hillary is giving you a big tax increase, your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nThis is only true if Trump's crowd is full of rich folks: Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners. \n2. Clinton deleted emails \"to cover up her crimes.\" \nClinton deleted 33,000 emails, thousands of which were found on other servers. FBI Director James Comey said, \"We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\" \n3. \"I pay contractors on time, I am so good.\" \nHundreds of contractors including cabinet makers, dishwashers, waitresses and more have alleged that their bills were not paid. One such contractor, a piano manufacturer, said the quality of his work was never contested by the Trump Organization. They simply said they were \"short on funds\" and would only pay 70 percent of the bill. \n4. \"Murders in the United States are up 45 \u2014 did you see the numbers \u2014 the highest they've been in 45 years. Murder's the highest it's been in 45 years.\" \nIt's not, though the murder rate hike is at its highest point in 45 years. \n5. Trump said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency endorsed him. \nAgain: They did not; a union of some of their employees did. \n6. \"[The military has] fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where they're on display. They have to plane graveyards because they don't make the parts anymore. \" \nThere's some truth to Trump's statement. Politifact reached out to a range of third-party experts and found that some military jets are more than 20 years old. But that's not to say that the U.S. military doesn't invest in new planes for its forces. What Trump Got Right and Wrong On Friday \nHere's what Trump got wrong, and right, in his Friday afternoon speech. \n1. \"Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nUnless Trump's crowd is filled with extremely wealthy Americans, their taxes will not go \"way down.\" \nThe wealthy would see the biggest tax cut under Trump's plan, according to the conservative Tax Foundation's analysis. The bottom 80% of Americans, would see 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent more after-tax income thanks to Trump's tax cuts. The richest 1 percent of Americans would see income gains between 10 percent and 16 percent. \n2. \"Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep, but really she's just resting.\" \nIt's true that Clinton doesn't have any publicly scheduled events until after the debate, but there is no evidence she is napping. She prepares at length: For a previous debate , Clinton hunkered down in hotels near her home for day-long sessions of debate prep with her advisors, often working until very late at night. \n3. \"Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress\u2026and she said get rid of 'em, delete 'em, bleach 'em, nobody bleaches because it's such an expensive process, she bleaches them, and then she made everyone get rid of iPhones, hammer them.\" \nClinton requested that 33,000 emails deemed personal by her team be deleted weeks before the Congressional subpoena; she did not stop their deletion, but it was not a direct response to the subpoena. She did not use an expensive process to delete her emails. She used a free app called BleachBit. Some of her mobile phones were destroyed with a hammer, but that was also not a response to the Congressional subpoena. \n4. Trump said Qatar gave $1 million dollars for \"Bill Clinton's birthday party.\" \nThe Emirate gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million dollars as a birthday present; that money went towards charitable acts, not festivities. \n5. \"WikiLeaks shows media conspires with the campaign, including giving the questions and answers before the debate.\" \nCNN and DNC Chair Donna Brazile deny that a debate question was ever given to the Clinton campaign, though an email does appear to show a question being offered up by Brazile to the Clinton campaign. \n6. \"I have no idea who these women are,\" Trump said of the women who have come forward to accuse him of improper sexual advances and groping. \nThis has become a routine denial for Trump, but months before he started denying he knew a Miss Utah who accused him of kissing her on the lips without consent, he argued that she'd personally recanted the story and that she was a \"nice girl.\" \n7. \"Biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\" ", "Charge Mexico $10,000.00 or more, for each Central American apprehended at the US southern border.

A few months after leaving the military, he was arrested and charged with discharging a firearm from a vehicle. No one was hurt, but the crime made him deportable. Barajas pleaded guilty and after two years in jail, Barajas was deported to Mexico. \nVeterans who serve the military as green card holders, not citizens, can be deported after committing certain crimes - including some minor offenses such as possession of marijuana and some more serious crimes such as murder and rape. \nThe Honorably Discharged, Dishonorably Deported coalition has had multiple conversations with the Clinton campaign staff, which has been supportive of protecting veterans from deportation. The coalition has had one conversation with the Trump campaign, which members of the coalition say showed less interest and for the most part, was unresponsive. \nThe deportation of veterans is not specifically discussed by either candidate on their websites and the issue has not come up at the previous two debates. \nNathan Fletcher, a veteran who previously served in the California State Assembly and now chairs the coalition, said he ultimately wants the two presidential nominees to publicly take a stance. \nFletcher and others from the coalition have asked the Commission on Presidential Debates to include two questions about deported veterans in Wednesday's debate. So far, the commission and others with influence in choosing the debate questions have not said if either question will come up, but members of the coalition say there's interest in making it happen. \n\"We want the candidates to take a firm position on an issue that we believe is so important,\" Fletcher said, adding that having the candidates talk about deported veterans would help elevate the national conversation around the issue.

MANDEL NGAN / AFP - Getty Images \nRelated: Latino Lawmakers, Others Push to Stop Veterans' Deportations \nOne of the questions members of the coalition want Clinton and Trump to answer is what they would do to ensure honorably discharged veterans are not deported. \nThey also want to know what the candidates would do to ensure deported veterans receive the quality medical care they earn through their military service. \nAll who serve honorably in the U.S. military, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to treatment at Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. But according to a July 2016 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, \"few deported veterans are granted the necessary waivers to access that care either in the states or abroad.\" \nFletcher explained that veterans who live in countries like Germany do have access to their health care benefits. \"But if you're deported to the streets of Tijuana, for example, you do not because there aren't VA facilities there.\" \nHe said the problem could be solved by having the State Department work with foreign consular offices to ensure deported veterans get medical care wherever they live. But in order for that to happen, Congress needs to pass legislation. \nThere's another route: executive action. \nMembers of the coalition want Obama to take executive action before he leaves office in January. In a meeting with White House officials last month, they called for the president to halt the deportation proceedings of veterans and pave a path for deported veterans to come back. \nThey also want the president to make permanent a discretionary program run by U.S. Customs and Immigration Service that helps green card holders serving in the military apply for citizenship. \nFletcher said often green card holders, who are legal residents, erroneously believe they automatically become citizens when they enlist in the military. When they get in trouble with the law, sometimes as a result of untreated post-traumatic stress, they are surprised when they are placed into deportation proceedings.

The contours of the race have usually solidified and knock-out punches are hard to land (John McCain's \"Joe the Plumber\" gamble backfired). With the end in site, candidates stick to talking points and do their best to motivate their established supporters to turn out. \nThis, however, is no ordinary election, and the debates between Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton have been anything but predictable. Their second debate was largely overshadowed by an unearthed 2005 tape of Trump making lewd comments about sexually assaulting women, and Trump's decision to bring as his guests women who had alleged the inappropriate conduct of former President Bill Clinton. \nVoters have become downtrodden by recent events, and reports suggest that viewers are both sick of the tension and disappointed by the lack of substance from the two leading candidates for president. \nRelated: Poll: Clinton Maintains Solid National Lead \nThe race has devolved into a personality contest between two historically unpopular nominees, and the issues voters care about the most have often been downplayed or overlooked altogether. \nHere are 10 major topics that have yet to be addressed substantively, but might still come up Wednesday when Clinton and Trump share the stage one last time: \nImmigration \u2014 Trump's campaign has been bolstered from the beginning by his audacious (and some have argued racially prejudiced) positions on immigration. The issue has long been a top concern for voters, yet it's barely been mentioned in the debates so far. Surprisingly, the vice presidential debate was the one debate during which a direct question on immigration policy was asked.

But there has been no question or discussion about the Republican nominee's signature immigration policy proposals \u2014 the building of border wall that will supposedly by funded by Mexico, and the forced deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. \nLGBT rights \u2014 The issue bubbled up consistently during the primaries (Ted Cruz bet big on bathroom paranoia) and has become a major national issue in aftermath of states like North Carolina passing bills that many believe infringe on the civil liberties of LGBT people. But it never made its way to the debate stage, which was especially surprising during the VP debate, since GOP nominee Mike Pence signed one of the first so-called \"religious freedom\" bills as governor of Indiana. \nLGBT rights is one of the few areas where Trump actually seems to be on the left of Republican party orthodoxy. He's said in the past that Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman, should be able to use the bathroom of her choice. On the other hand, he has said he opposes same-sex marriage. Clinton, who opposed same-sex marriage during the 2008 election, has evolved on that issue. For some, LGBT equality is the civil rights issue of our time, so for it to get no mention during the 2016 debates would be a huge oversight.

This year several states \u2014 including California, Nevada, Florida and Maine \u2014 are going to have drug reform laws on the ballot, which could either minimize penalties for possession or legalize medicinal use. Where do the candidates stand on this issue? It hasn't been discussed. Considering how much attention was paid to the heroin epidemic in states like New Hampshire, the candidates haven't been asked about their plans to combat addiction or crack down on the illegal drug trade. \n\"It's concerning to me that cannabis legalization hasn't received much attention during this election cycle. Six states have full adult-use legalization on the ballot, yet what do the candidates have to say?\" Kyle Sherman, co-founder and CEO of Flowhub , told NBC News. \"There is an obvious surge in public concern around the issue, yet this election cycle has seen much less coverage on the topic than others in the past. The questions are certainly there, there just hasn't been enough discussion on the issue to see anything remotely close to an answer.\" \nMedicare and Social Security \u2014 There is a great deal of anxiety about solvency and future of the two most popular so-called entitlement programs, particularly among the generation of Americans poised to enter into the system. Both Trump and Clinton have pledged to leave Social Security and Medicare untouched as president, but neither was pressed during the first two debates about how they would make sure each program remains solvent. Curiously, this was yet another topic that was addressed in the VP debate, where Democrat Tim Kaine pointed out that Trump had compared Social Security in the past to a \"Ponzi scheme,\" while Republican Mike Pence stated that his ticket would \"meet the obligations\" of both programs. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton makes a point during the second presidential debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri on Oct. 9, 2016. PAUL J. RICHARDS / AFP - Getty Images \nReproductive Rights \u2014 Although Hillary Clinton did say she wanted to appoint a Supreme Court justice who would preserve Roe v. Wade , there hasn't been a deep dive into one of the most divisive social issues in America. Donald Trump's controversial assertion \u2014 later retracted \u2014 that women should be \"punished\" if they get an abortion was only revisited in the VP debate when Pence insisted that neither he nor his running mate would support legislation that punished women. Kaine, who is personally opposed to the procedure, asked rhetorically: \"Why doesn't Donald Trump trust women to make this choice for themselves?\" \nSexual Assault (on Colleges Campuses and in the Military) \u2014 To the shock of many voters, allegations of sexual assault levied at Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's husband, Bill Clinton, have sucked much of the oxygen out of presidential debates so far. But there has been no discussion about the epidemic of sexual assaults on college campuses or the outbreak of sexual violence in the military. \nRelated: Hillary Clinton to Spend 5 Days Preparing for Las Vegas Debate \nTrump has tweeted that \"no one\" has more respect for women than he does, and has linked incidents of sexual assault in the military to the fact that men and women serve together. When pressed on this controversial position at NBC's Commander-in-Chief Forum last month, he doubled down . Both candidates should probably make plain their positions on women in combat, including whether or not they can or should serve alongside men, and also how they intend to address threats and violence directed towards women in environments where the public presumes a reasonable degree of safety and security, like our institutions of higher education.

Carmen Sesin Share advertisement \nORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Ramon Troche Pacheco, 77, said that like his father before him, he favors Democratic candidates. So, on November 8, he will vote for Hillary Clinton. But for the U.S. Senate race, he will vote for Republican incumbent Marco Rubio. \n\"Rubio is my boy. He is mi gente (my people). He is Latino - mi raza,\" Troche Pacheco said in Spanish, while looking over the food displayed at Melao Bakery, a popular restaurant that serves a wide array of traditional Puerto Rican dishes and sweets. \nPuerto Ricans like Troche Pacheco are part of a mass exodus of islanders moving to the U.S. mainland, spurred by the effects of the island's massive debt crisis. \nFor the past five years he and his wife have been frequently going between Orlando and Puerto Rico. But he said that on his next trip he will sell what is left of his island properties and live permanently in the U.S. \nBor\u00edcuas, as they are also known, are the fastest growing group in Florida and are transforming the state's electoral map. An appealing electorate that could be key vote \nIt's estimated that each month around 900 Puerto Rican families move from the island to the mainland, according to the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. \nThere are over 1 million Puerto Ricans in Florida, according to census data analyzed by the CUNY Center for Puerto Rican Studies. Not all are from the island; there are also transplants from the Northeast looking for warm weather and a more affordable lifestyle. \nMany of the newcomers are settling into the area known as the Interstate 4 or I-4 corridor, which covers several densely populated counties from Tampa to Daytona Beach. Around 400,000 have settled in the Orlando area. \nOverall, Orlando feels like a suburb of Puerto Rico. There are Puerto Rican restaurants and businesses throughout the main thoroughfares, and there is constant travel back and forth between here and the island.

And when you exchange phone numbers with people, you see many that begin with 787 -- the area code of Puerto Rico. It's evident from talking to people they have very strong ties to the island. \n\"I have never seen the extent of solidarity between Puerto Ricans on the island and Puerto Ricans in the U.S. as I have seen in the past couple of years - those ties are very intimate,\" said University of Central Florida history professor, Luis Martinez Fernandez . \nThe latest polls show a very close race in the state, and during the past few election cycles, presidential races in Florida have been won by a small margin. \nRELATED : More Democrat-Leaning Miami Cubans, Latinos Could Help Clinton Win Fla. \nThe influx of Puerto Ricans since the last election cycle could be what closes the gap in this year's race. \nPuerto Ricans born in the island are U.S. citizens so they are eligible to vote in presidential elections once they reside in the mainland. \nPuerto Rican newcomers are less aligned with political parties than previous waves who settled in New York or Chicago and tended to vote Democrat. According to Edwin Mel\u00e9ndez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at the City University of New York, party affiliation means less to more recent arrivals who are more apt to vote for the candidate who appeals to them most. \nOne poll from early October shows Florida Puerto Ricans overwhelmingly support Hillary Clinton by 74 percent. Seventeen percent said they would vote for Trump. But the poll also indicated they are split on the Senate race between Marco Rubio and his Democratric rival, Patrick Murphy. Ensuring registration, turnout and early voting \nThe influx of bor\u00edcuas has sent organizations scrambling to make sure potential new voters were registered by the deadline and casting ballots early. \nMaria Hern\u00e1ndez of Organize Now, a non-profit community group, has been working to rally people to vote through a coalition of progressive Latino groups called \"Que Vote M\u00ed Gente\" which translates to \"Vote, My People.\" \nThe group recently joined forces with Latin salsa singer Frankie Negr\u00f3n, who is Puerto Rican, in a video, \"Que Vote M\u00ed Gente.\" The song is a remake of the hit song \"M\u00ed Gente\" from the late iconic Puerto Rican salsa musician Hector Lavoe. \nThe Hispanic Federation has produced several Spanish-language ads that are running in major networks as well as Puerto Rico's WAPA TV urging Puerto Ricans- especially young people - to vote. \nThe coalition has spent a great deal of time explaining the voting process to newly arrived Puerto Ricans. Many are unfamiliar with the political parties and the electoral process. Puerto Rico requires a voting registration card; in Florida, other identification cards can be used under Florida's voter ID law. \nBut what the coalition has focused on most is encouraging early voting. \n\"A hurricane can happen. The car can break down. Your kids can get sick,\" Hern\u00e1ndez said. \"This is the I-4 corridor, so this is where elections are decided.\" \nOutside a supermarket last week, volunteers Wilma Carrero and Maria Merced stopped every shopper on their way out to ask if they had registered; if they had, did they wish to vote by mail? Some said they had already voted, others had questions about the process. Wilma Carrero and Maria Merced from the coalition #QueVoteMiGente speak to voter Nancy Gomez outside a supermarket in Orlando. Carmen Sesin \nNancy G\u00f3mez, who moved from Puerto Rico 14 years ago, said she had already filled out her absentee ballot - she voted Democrat - but was unsure about mailing it. \n\"I'm afraid of it getting lost in the mail, so I'm going to take it personally,\" she said. \nPuerto Ricans are expected to turn out in high numbers. As many as 84 percent of Puerto Ricans polled at the beginning of October said they would likely vote. This is a huge margin compared to Latinos overall, who have a lower turnout rate. Only 48 percent of Hispanic eligible voters cast ballots in 2012. Vilma Perez moved from Puerto Rico two years ago where she worked in finance. She is not enthusiastic about the two presidential candidates but will vote for Hillary Clinton because of her experience in government. Carmen Sesin \nFor Vilma P\u00e9rez, who moved to Orlando two years ago, Puerto Rico's debt is a key issue. On the island, where she worked in finance, she always followed the U.S. elections. She feels they used to be more \"pacific\" and not as \"aggressive\" as this year. \nShe isn't enthusiastic about the choices this year. \"For me, this is not what you expect from the presidential candidates for the most powerful nation in the world,\" Perez said. \nBut for her, the best option is Clinton because of her experience in government. Campaigns make final push \nBoth candidates and their surrogates have campaigned heavily in Florida, coming more frequently as Election Day nears. Barack Obama was in Orlando Friday urging millennials to carry out his legacy by voting for Clinton; he will return to South Florida on Thursday.

She says many of the islanders who have been migrating to Florida are from the New Progressive Party, which advocates for statehood. People who favor this party tend to be more conservative, said Cabrera Morris, an observation that Mel\u00e9ndez also shared.

Bush, Rubio, and Mitt Romney. \n\"There is a silent majority of Hispanics that vote their conscience - and that Hillary Clinton needs to be worried about,\" Cabrera Morris said. \nSeveral miles away at the Republican National Committee's (RNC) Winter Park field office, a team of volunteers were working the phones with the \"absentee ballot push,\" - reminding voters to send their vote by mail ballots. \n\"I'm not lacking on my volunteers. As we get closer to the elections, they are coming by and filling up the office,\" said office manager Melissa McGee. She said they have 15 phones that are manned 12 hours a day. At the RNC Winter Park office near Orlando, manager Melissa McGee, and volunteers work the phones to make sure voters cast their ballots early. Carmen Sesin \nDemocrats have been busy mobilizing bor\u00edcuas in Florida - and the island. \nFederico de Jes\u00fas, a principal at FDJ Solutions and a Clinton surrogate, said her campaign has been mobilizing people in Puerto Rico to contact their relatives in Florida and ask them to register and vote early for Clinton. There is phone banking on the island and there are surrogates doing television and radio interviews. \nThe campaign has also focused on an another important group: \"This campaign has done a lot to reach out to millennials,\" said de Jes\u00fas. They make up almost half of Hispanic eligible voters and Clinton needs them to turn out in large numbers to win Florida - something young voters are not known to do. De Jes\u00fas thinks the outreach will make a difference. \nThe Clinton and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) have an extensive network of campaign offices and volunteers. According to a Clinton campaign aide, about 1-in-4 state volunteers speak Spanish and can communicate easily with recent arrivals from the island. At a Clinton field office in Orlando, volunteers make calls urging voters to cast their ballots early. Carmen Sesin \nAs far as campaign ads, voters in Florida have not seen much of Trump. \nHe has lagged behind Clinton in the amount of money spent on TV ads. As of the week of Oct. 2-8, Clinton and pro-Clinton groups had outspent Trump and pro-Trump groups on TV ads in Florida, $46.6 million to $14.1 million. But spending is ongoing and those sums are changing. How much support will Trump get? \nEven though polls indicate Puerto Ricans favor Clinton, there is no denying there is support for Trump. \nZoriemy Rivera moved to Florida three years ago. She, her husband and their 19 year-old son are Republican and are voting for Trump. Rivera and her husband, both engineers, decided to leave Puerto Rico because the quality of life had declined. \"We were paying a lot of money for a private school so our son could be bilingual,\" she said. \nNational security and health care are top issues for Rivera. \"I think national security is very important and the border needs to be secured,\" she said. She also thinks \"Obamacare is going to bring problems, which we are already beginning to see and they will get worse.\" \nHer son, Jes\u00fas Gabriel Sanchez, a University of Central Florida student studying engineering, also said he supports Trump \"because I was raised with moral values that resemble the Republican Party the most.\" \nOne group of Puerto Ricans in Florida that have the potential to lean Republican is evangelicals. \n\"One thing that people might not realize is that in the last 30 years, evangelicals have grown dramatically and are now half the church-going population. The percentage of Puerto Rican evangelicals here is higher than in Puerto Rico,\" said Mart\u00ednez Fernandez, the University of Central Florida history professor. \nRELATED: Republican Latinos in Swing-State Florida Publicly Support Hillary Clinton \nBut it's difficult to predict who they will vote for because they support different issues across the spectrum. Puerto Rican evangelicals may support immigration reform and an increase to the minimum wage, but they generally oppose abortion and same sex marriage. \nMel\u00e9ndez, the CUNY Puerto Rican studies center director, thinks one of the reasons Clinton is doing so well among Puerto Ricans is because she is running against Trump. The controversies he has been involved in and his statements about Mexicans and undocumented immigrants have alienated many Puerto Ricans. \nEven though immigration policy does not affect Puerto Ricans, \"it's the perception that he is anti-us,\" said Mel\u00e9ndez. \"I think any other [Republican] candidate would have split the vote a different way.\" \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Our Latino panel points out the hits and misses and whether the two men made their case.\nMike Pence Refused to Defend the Indefensible Raul Reyes / Raul Reyes Live from what Mike Pence mistakenly referred to as \"Norwood University,\" on Tuesday night it was Feisty vs. Folksy. Tim Kaine mounted an aggressive attack on Donald Trump, while Mike Pence attempted the seemingly impossible task of defending his running mate's controversial comments. If the goal were to make this matchup a referendum on Trump, Kaine came away the winner.\nUnlike the last debate, this one featured a spirited discussion of immigration. Kaine drove home the point that he and Clinton support immigration reform with a path to citizenship, though he might have added that this is supported by majorities of Americans too. Kaine smartly reminded viewers of Trump's remarks about Mexicans and immigrants, and even worked in a mention of his unfounded allegations of bias against Judge Gonzalo Curiel. In response, Pence mentioned what he called an \"endorsement\" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But ICE is a federal agency and cannot \"endorse\" any candidate. In fact, Trump was endorsed by an ICE officers union - which in any case is unlikely to win him more support among Hispanic voters.\nNeither moderator Elaine Quijano nor Kaine brought up Pence's support for Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which originally allowed discrimination against LGBT people on so-called religious grounds. LGBT rights is an issue that resonates with Latinos; a Public Religion Research Institute poll found that three-quarters of Hispanics support laws that protect LGBT people from discrimination. So here Kaine missed a shot at drawing another distinction between the two tickets.\nAlso not mentioned: Trump's alleged violations of the Cuba trade embargo (recently outlined in Newsweek ), which could have consequences among Cuban-American voters. Any why didn't Kaine break out just a little of his espa\u00f1ol, which would have guaranteed him marquee coverage in Spanish-language media?\nThat said, Kaine fulfilled his responsibility in this debate, because he succeeded in keeping Pence on the defensive about his running mate. \"He's (Pence) asking everybody to vote for somebody that he cannot defend,\" Kaine noted . Many viewers at home were probably thinking the same thing.\nRaul Reyes is an NBC Latino contributor, attorney, journalist and TV commentator.\nTim Kaine was a Slugger, Mike Pence a Bunter If tonight's vice presidential debate were to be described in baseball terminology, Senator Tim Kaine would be a 'slugger,' and Governor Mike Pence would be a 'bunter.' Kaine came out swinging with a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton's candidacy, and branded Donald Trump as self-interested, untrustworthy, and frightening.\nPence, on the other hand, took a subdued approach, just barely stepping up to the plate, and doing what he could to lay down the barrage of critiques leveled at his presidential nominee. Pence kept the ball in play, but he never seemed to get off a 'line drive.'\nThroughout the night, Kaine championed Clinton's credentials and was refreshingly direct in the way he addressed criticism against her. More impressive was his ability to flip almost any script Pence issued to drag her down.\nWhen Pence suggested that Clinton was capitalizing on fraught relations between police and the Black community, Kaine confidently stated that the nation shouldn't be afraid to talk about bias in law enforcement. When Pence described Trump as 'brilliantly' using the tax code to avoid paying federal taxes, Kaine asked whether it was smart to not pay for the military, veterans and teachers, then topped off his retort with, \"So, does that make the rest of us stupid?\" With frequent sighs and head shaking, Pence never seemed to fully wrest the terms of the debate from Kaine's control.\nIf Pence's performance tonight was lackluster, his unexcitable demeanor should at least appeal to that portion of the GOP who under no circumstances will vote for Hillary Clinton, but who are also wondering how they could vote for a man so many have come to see as rude, narcissistic, and reckless. By painting Kaine as overly prepared with his \"pre-done lines,\" (a depiction that will nicely compliment their perception of Clinton as staged and inauthentic) Pence will assure the anti-Clinton camp that her running mate is more of the same.\nA vice presidential candidate should be able to defend the person at the top of the ticket. Kaine not only defended Clinton, he made a thoughtful case for her. But, when Kaine asked Pence to defend the litany of offensive statements Trump has made about Mexicans, women, Senator John McCain, Indiana-born judge Gonzalo Curiel, President Barack Obama, and the African American community, Pence simply didn't, and it is on this point where he most clearly 'struck out.'\nTehama Lopez Bunyasi is an Assistant Professor in the School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University.\nIt's Form Over Substance for Mike Pence Stephen A.

With Pence clearly facing the tallest order of defending Trump, he took a tack instead by sidestepping Trump's opaque policies on nuclear policy and abortion, and turning Trump's own offensive remarks against Kaine, as if repeating Trump's statements was itself offensive.\nWhatever success Pence was able to garner from the initial optics of his performance in contrast to Kaine, who seemed anxious, shifty, and often talking over the female moderator, I get the sense that Pence's performance will deteriorate in utility as his statements are matched with those of Donald Trump's.\nIt sometimes felt like a Cold War debate in the 1980s, with Russian invasions, Middle Eastern strife, and nuclear proliferation taking center stage for much of the debate. It's worth noting that the Latino Decisions tracking poll showed that almost 70 percent of Latinos trusted Clinton to keep Americans safe from domestic and international terrorism, and only 11 percent of Latinos saying they trust Trump. Similarly, over 70 percent of Latinos trust Clinton with strengthening relations with Latin America. Unfortunately, foreign policy with Latin America was ignored.\nWith two white men taking center stage, it would have been nice to tease out greater contrast between the two on social and cultural issues. The question about religion was awkward, where the two competed to demonstrate which was more virtuous. Instead of asking a question on their personal religious beliefs, it would have been much more informative to discuss their views on LGBT issues, abortion (beyond it's religious value), and equal opportunity.\nOverall, Kaine was defective with the sound bites, like touting Trump as the \"you're fired administration\", but strong on policy details.\nPence was the opposite, hitting hard and repeatedly on soundbites and phrases like \"higher taxes\", which nonetheless will look immensely awkward given Trump's continued insistence on not releasing his taxes. Yet Pence was practically non-existent on policy details.\nWhile Kaine is sufficient, I'm left wondering what this debate would have looked like with a more fiery Tom Perez , the Secretary of Labor who was considered for the job, or a more cerebral Juli\u00e1n Castro , whose education at Stanford and Harvard would have surely been a visual and substantive contrast that could not be ignored and would continue to be a focal point in light of Trump's inflammatory remarks on immigration, Muslims, and policing policies.\nStephen Nu\u00f1o is an Associate Professor at Northern Arizona University and a regular contributor to NBC Latino.\nFollow NBC News Latino ", "Oct 11 2016, 12:29 pm ET Pew Report Finds Democrats Continue to Struggle with Latino Millennials by Stephen A. Nu\u00f1o A woman walks past a polling place in San Francisco's Chinatown Tuesday, Nov. 8, 2011. Ben Margot / AP Share advertisement \nThe newest report from Pew Research Center Hispanic Trends is a mixed bag of good news and looming challenges for the Democrats and politics in general. Despite the overwhelming number of Hispanics who will cast votes for Democrats in the next election, young Hispanics continue to send clear signals to both political parties that they are not connecting with their concerns. \nPolitical scientists place significant importance on a subject they call political efficacy, the belief by someone that their political participation will make a difference, and their confidence that they would be able to understand the system enough to make a change if they needed to. Low levels of political efficacy have long been seen to have a discouraging impact on voter turnout, the gold standard measure of political participation in a democracy. \nRELATED : Latino Millennials Among Most Worried By White Extremism: Poll \nPew's latest numbers highlight this problem among Hispanics, with 57 percent of respondents saying they were dissatisfied with the nation's direction, up from this time in 2012. \nMost concerning, the share of Latino registered voters who say they are \"absolutely certain\" they will vote this November is down from 77 percent in 2012 to 69 percent in 2016. This is \"after more than a year of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump making provocative comments about Mexican and Muslim immigrants and Hispanics in general,\" the report's authors note. \nWith almost half of the Hispanic population belonging to the \"millennial generation\", failing to connect with this demographic can have a long term negative impact on governance, as well as implications for the ability of Democrats to maintain its high vote share of Latinos. \nMore concerning for Democrats is the number of millennials willing to cast their vote for someone other than Hillary Clinton, with less than half of millennials \u2014 48 percent \u2014 saying they would cast their vote for her and 15 percent of millennials interviewed saying they would vote for Donald Trump. The rest split their votes between Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, or did not say. \nRELATED: For 2016, Almost Half of the Latino Electorate will be Millennials \nWith 64 percent of Millennial Latino voters who back Clinton saying their support is more a vote against Trump than for Clinton, Democrats will need to consider whether their luck of running against a string of Republican candidates who Latinos simply could not support may run out at sometime soon. \nIn an election season where the Republicans have essentially abandoned any hope of attracting Latino voters, it is also concerning for Democrats that their share of Latino voters has remained relatively stable over the last 16 years. \nThe share of Latino voters who identify with the Republican Party has remained constant since 1999, according to Pew's historical data, where it was 25 percent. Today that number is 24 percent, perhaps suggesting a that Democrats have reached a limit to their ability to attract a greater share of Latino voters. \nOther findings from the report: Among Latino registered voters, education is the top issue of concern (83 percent) followed by the economy, health care, terrorism and then immigration. One-in-five Hispanic registered voters will be casting their ballots for the first time Overall, Clinton supporters are more likely to be women, Catholic, foreign born, Spanish dominant and have a high school degree. Trump supporters tend to be male, U.S. born, English dominant, evangelical and have some college experience. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Stephen A.

Meet A Group of Talented Latino Animators by Edgar Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Jr. Hispanic Talent Key to Creation of Latest 'Ice Age: Collision Course' 1:29 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/783669827526\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nGREENWICH, Connecticut \u2014 The \"Ice Age\" movies have delighted young and old and garnered millions of fans around the world. It turns out a talented group of Hispanics are a key part to the creation of the lovable characters that fans have come to love. \n\"Ice Age: Collision Course,\" released this summer, garnered $403.4M at the box office. In this latest installment, Scrat and other beloved characters must save the world from an oncoming meteor strike. The movie will be available on DVD and BluRay on Tuesday, October 11th, and we got a chance to visit some of the movie's creators. \nBlue Sky Studios, responsible for the beloved 14-year-old \"Ice Age\" franchise as well as \"Rio\" and \"Epic,\" churns out its films from its headquarters in a beautifully manicured corporate office park in Greenwich, Connecticut. \nThat's where we met Lluis Llobera and Elena Ortego, two animators originally from Spain. We also got a chance to speak to Antelmo Villarreal, a senior assembly technical director and Roberto Calvo, the film's CG supervisor, both U.S. Latinos. \nRELATED: The animator of \"Ice Age: Continental Drift\" shares what he loves most about his job \nThe group gave us a behind-the-scenes look at the almost four-year-long process to take the film from concept art to the final product. It's such a laborious process that just three seconds of film take an animator an entire 40-hour work week. \nLluis Llobera, originally from the Catalonian region of Spain, always dreamed of becoming an animator; he began drawing from early childhood. Llobera began learning computer animation on his own in his native Spain, then worked in Scotland, before coming to the United States, which he considers the mecca of animation. He's worked at Blue Sky Studios for some nine years and in that time has animated characters in most of the \"Ice Age\" films, as well as \"Horton Hears A Who,\" and \"Rio,\" among others. \nFor \"Ice Age: Collision Course,\" Llobera worked on a number of characters, including Sid, Diego and Manny. It's a very painstaking process, but Llobera said it's always exciting. \"It's very creative, I never tired of it, every scene presents a new challenge,\" Llobera said. \n\"In computer animation, you have to be very meticulous,\" said Llobero. \"You start animating the characters, but then you even end up animating their right eyebrow.\" \nElena Ortego, an animator from Spain's Basque Country, was the lead animator for Brooke, Sid's love interest. Unlike Llobera, Ortego did not draw as a child and assured us she can't even draw with pencil and paper. \nAs surprising as it may seem to moviegoers, it's not a necessary skill to enter 3D computer animation, according to the film's animators. Ortego began her career in her native Spain, then in France and subsequently came to the United States to work at Blue Sky Studios. She describes coming to Blue Sky Studios as \"being called to play soccer for a division one team.\" \nOrtego is very creative\u2014in her spare time she creates all kinds of handicrafts\u2014 and she gestures in front of a mirror and records herself acting to already recorded lines of dialogue, to figure out how a character should move in a way that's not run-of-the-mill. \nOrtego will record herself acting out the same scene over and over for some two hours just to find inspiration to animate 30 seconds of film. Initially, Ortego said she was embarrassed of sharing her behind-the-scenes acting videos with bosses, but now it's become a key part of her animation process. \nUnlike Llobera and Ortego, Antelmo Villarreal, of Mexican descent, was born in the United States and his work is more on the technical side of the filmmaking process. \nRELATED: Disney Animator Jose Zelaya Learned to Draw During Salvadoran Civil War \n\"They hand me this concept art sheet, I bring it to life in 3D and then I pass it off to lighting and animation for the final product,\" said Villareal about his work in \"Ice Age: Collision Course.\" Villarreal said he does this by bringing together different elements made by other animation departments to create the 360-degree world the \"Ice Age\" characters inhabit. \nBefore scenes make it to the film's directors, the work of different departments all goes through a computer graphics supervisor. \nRoberto Calvo, a twenty-year veteran of the animation industry, was the sole CG supervisor for \"Ice Age: Collision Course.\" His job is to ensure--in a technical capacity-- that the director's vision comes to life. \nHis path to animated films was somewhat untraditional as he studied computer science and first entered an animation studio fixing computers. Afterward, Calvo began to write computer code necessary to build the software needed for animated films. It was then that he began to work in the creation of animated films themselves. What he loves the best about his field is that it's a marriage of technical and creative talents. \nLlobera, Ortego, Villrreal and Calvo all love their field and welcome more Hispanic talent \u2014 whether immigrant or U.S. born \u2014 to enter animation. \nVillarreal's advice to young Latinos with dreams of entering the animation industry is simple, but impactful: \"First, dream big, then school, and lots and lots of work.\" He said aspiring animators need to have big dreams and aspirations as well as obtain a four-year education, and then just work tirelessly in mastering their craft. \nBlue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox, employs some 500 staffers; close to one hundred are animators. \nEdgar Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Jr. is a producer based in Noticias Telemundo's New York bureau for the network's national-evening newscast, \"Noticiero Telemundo.\" Telemundo is a division of NBCUniversal .

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Map Your Route and Go Over It With Kids\nIf you want to get the best out of your Halloween outings, know exactly where you're going and how you're getting there.\n\"Map out a route a few days before, drive around and determine which streets look safe and well-lit,\" said Pamela McMurty, mom of seven, and the author of A Harvest and Halloween Handbook. \"Make a treasure map if you are really cool.\"\nHalloween is one of the most hectic of all the holidays, at least when it comes to children, who are decked out in costumes and bouncing off the walls thanks to all that sugar. This is why parents should sit down with their little ones ahead of the big day to discuss what their trick-or-treating plan is and highlight the importance of staying nearby at all times.\n\"Before trick-or-treating, talk with your children about where you are going and how many houses you plan to visit,\" said Rachel Robertson, VP of education and development at the child care provider Bright Horizons Family Solutions.\nAlso go over dos and don'ts. Robertson recommends sticking to sidewalks, and only crossing the streets at corners. Make sure kids know these and any other rules well before venturing out.\nCollaborate With Your Neighbors\nIf you live in a close-knit neighborhood or gated community, consider working with your neighbors to make a trick-or-treating experience everyone can enjoy. Garcia recommends hosting a \"Neighborhood Trunk-Or-Treat,\" a concept she says was developed by her Homeowners Association, and one that has taken off in her community.\n\"All of the neighbors in my gated community deck out their cars and SUVs with really cool Halloween decorations and hand out candy from their trunks,\" said Garcia. \"This is a great way to avoid your door bell from ringing all evening. Plus the added bonus is it's usually held between 5-7pm, which allows kids enough time to finish their homework and dinner.\"\nThere are other ways you can come together with neighbors. For instance, you can organize a group outing and designate other parents as supervisors, or if you can't go out with kids yourself, a trusted neighbor can take your place.\nGo Early\nChances are you'll want to be back home by a reasonable hour, but there are other incentives to head out early.\nFelicia Ramos-Peters, holiday expert and founder of the blog Get Holiday Happy, points out that many towns have curfews. Also, the later it gets the more likely that you will encounter people running out of candy. Early birds get the (gummy) worm...\nVisit Apartment Complexes and Malls\nIf you live or have access to an urban area, you can save time and maximize your candy earnings by visiting an apartment complex.\n\"I have always found apartment complexes to be the best for trick-or-treating,\" said Ramos-Peters. \"If you don't have much time or only want to be out for a little while, then an apartment complex is the best way to go.\"\nIf you're in a very rural area, or if you prefer a brightly lit, professional setting, go to your local mall. Hitting up retailers may not have that same cozy, nostalgic feel as dropping in on your neighbors, but your kids will likely have a blast, and you can get a lot accomplished in a short amount of time.\n\"The mall is a great place to take small children during Halloween,\" said Kendra Garcia, author and Autism mom advocate/speaker. \"They have the opportunity to go trick or treating 'door-door,' or should I say 'store-to-store.' It's fun, safe and it also allows mommy or daddy to do a little shopping at the same time.\"\nGo To Affluent Neighborhoods\nIf one thing has remained true about trick-or-treating over the course of time, it's that the wealthier neighborhoods will generally have the most generous candy offerings.\n\"I hate to be materialistic, but the best candy is often in the more affluent areas,\"said McMurty. \"I learned quickly as an adolescent that the upper-end neighborhoods were giving away full-size candy like Firestix and Snickers.\"\nLook For The Teal Pumpkins\nIf your child has any dietary allergies, you probably already know to be extremely vigilant on Halloween and to seek out residences that have teal pumpkins on display. These pumpkins mean they are giving out treats that are allergy-friendly.\nBeauty Momme blogger Saarah S. notes that these teal pumpkins can also represent homes that are giving out treats to appeal to health-focused parents \u2014 meaning no trans-fats, food dyes, or other chemical-heavy items.", "Oct 18 2016, 4:12 pm ET Panda Express Celebrates 'Origin and Originality' With 'American Chinese' Campaign by Stephany Bai advertisement \nAndrea Cherng may only have started her role as chief marketing officer of Panda Restaurant Group three years ago, but her ties to the company, which operates the Panda Express chain, run much deeper. Cherng, whose parents Andrew and Peggy grew the company from a single restaurant in 1973, told NBC News that she has been a \"student of the brand\" for most of her life. \n\"At Panda, we purposefully chose to describe our food as American Chinese, to separate the Chinese-American identity, the personhood, from the food type of American Chinese,\" she said. \"We try to have thoughtfulness as to how we approach describing the duality of identity in both people in terms of the Asian-American community as well as food.\" Panda Restaurant Group founders Andrew and Peggy Cherng with Andrew's father (center). Panda Restaurant Group / Panda Restaurant Group \nCherng noted that thoughtfulness extends to how they approach their food as well. When Panda Express launched its new menu item \u2014 General Tso's chicken \u2014 this August, their team took care to trace its origins , mapping its journey from its beginnings in Taiwan to its introduction in New York, where it quickly became a staple of American Chinese food. \n\"Dishes like General Tso's and orange chicken are the reasons why Chinese immigrant families in the U.S. were able to provide for their families,\" said Cherng. \"The beauty of it now is that this American Chinese cuisine, instead of it being a means of survival for one family, can be celebrated as incredible entrepreneurship.\" \nRELATED: Panda Express Touts 'American Chinese Classic' with New General Tso's Chicken \nWith this spirit in mind, Cherng and the Panda Express team earlier this month launched the \"American Chinese\" campaign, which features discussions with Chinese-American creative leaders including \"Fresh Off The Boat\" producer Melvin Mar, journalist Lisa Ling, graphic novelist Gene Luen Yang , filmmaker Jennifer 8 Lee , architect Alvin Huang, and Andrea Cherng herself. A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \n\"If you think about food and if you think about culinary, it is a creative expression. An aspect of what we do and what we want to do at Panda is celebrating both origin as well as originality,\" Cherng said. \"Creative thought leaders paired very well with celebrating both.\" \nThe campaign's videos aim to tell the American Dream story from an \"American Chinese perspective,\" according to Cherng. In their interviews, the creatives share stories of their parents and their own struggle and success. Panda Restaurant Group CMO Andrea Cherng and architect Alvin Huang, AIA.

Not only am I incredibly proud of being American, I'm proud of being Chinese American specifically.\" A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nAndrea Cherng notes that as chefs and home cooks experiment with different ethnic cuisines, Panda emphasizes respecting the culinary origin and \"food memory\" of the dishes they serve. \n\"I think that what's really important in some ways is this idea of respect and memory, the connection to food,\" she said. \"Many of the dishes that we grew up with in our home as Asian Americans, as immigrants, have stories attached to them that have so much to do with our cultural identity.\" \nRELATED: Graphic Novelist Gene Luen Yang: Stories Are Mirrors, Windows to Life \nCherng continued, \"A part of who we are at Panda Express is, we are American Chinese.

Ali Vitali ", "I do make the distinction in my film. Not only is there African American and Korean American relations, it also talks about the inter-generational conflicts. There's a [character] named Mr. Kim who owns the liquor store across the street, and he's constantly fighting with the two brothers. That's how it is. They think, especially amongst Koreans, we're one team , but even within our culture there's a huge disparity between immigrants and the second generation that gets born here. I think that gets overlooked and we get grouped into \"Koreans.\" At that time I think the cultural disparity was even bigger. I think it's become a little better in terms of communication between parents and kids, but back then it was old country versus new country. That's a big part of the film as well.\nIf I didn't take it upon myself, these stories would not get told. What was the most difficult aspect of creating this movie?\nThe whole thing was really difficult. As you know, we're still trying to raise money on Kickstarter, so the financing was really difficult. But in terms of writing it, I was really sensitive with the Korean aspect of it and how Koreans were going to be portrayed, and also how African Americans were going to be portrayed. And gender! The main character is Kamilla, an 11-year-old African-American girl. Originally [the character] was a boy Kamal. I actually had other female characters in the film, but I had to cut some stuff away because of length and focusing on the real story. When I did that I didn't feel [the female perspective] got enough either, so I reworked Kamal into Kamilla and I think it was the best choice I could have made.\nKamilla, one of the characters in Justin Chon's \"Gook\" Birthday Soup Films It seems like a lot of thought went into making sure you had a range of voices represented in the movie.\nAbsolutely. I can't be perfect, and you know, it's a film. People are going to get mad, no matter what. Even the nature of the title, \"Gook,' is going to arouse some backlash and argument, I'm sure. I can't service everybody, but I was really conscious of what I was doing. I did try as best as I could. It is still from the Korean-American standpoint because it's a film. It needs to be from a point of view.\nYour op-ed for us in March got a great response in that a lot of people identified and thanked you for speaking out about a widespread problem in the industry. How do you feel the industry is changing with regards to representation, and how can we help continue improvement?\nI do feel it's very important that when there's a project worth investing in that we should speak with our wallets \u2014 which is kind of taboo for Asians, to talk about money, but it's so important. Film is the most expensive art form, but it's also the most wide-reaching art form. It has a life, where, after it comes out, future generations can come back and look at it. In terms of speaking out, I think that's also starting to change. There are people who are very vocal about their opinions on the industry and everything. I'm hopeful, but we still have a tremendously long way to go.\nI think people were really scared about losing their jobs or being the one that was going to be in the spotlight for speaking out. And it's valid. You don't want to jeopardize your career. It's sort of like a power in numbers, though, and if we don't band together and be vocal then how will they will acknowledge or be aware that anything is wrong in the first place.\nRelated: ' April's Way' Captures Stories of Korean-American Merchants During L.A.

They're not smart, they're just trying to make it work, they're really blue collar. Most films about Korean Americans are about a kid who's trying to get into college, or their parents are pressuring them into being a doctor or lawyer, or their mom is a tiger mom.

This Kickstarter will help us finish everything, because there's music we'd like to buy, we need to mix the sound, we need to do additional dialogue recording, graphics and all that stuff. At least in this phase, I think everyone's being a lot more supportive and I'm really thankful for that.\nJustin Chon in \"Gook.\" Birthday Soup Films And the goal is, this is a really festival-type movie. I think it's a beautiful movie, not just because it's my movie, but I think it's dynamic and the storylines are so compelling. The biggest thing for me in this film is the characters. The characters are so fully fleshed out and compelling, I think that's what the biggest strength is. They're not caricatures. And that's important for Asian Americans, that these are real people.\nWe're basically at our goal, but the way Kickstarter works is that you don't get anything if you don't make your goal. We actually need a lot more, so every dollar really does help make the film better. It exponentially makes the film better and better. The thirty grand lets us finish the bare minimum.

The average Filipino spends every spare peso on getting drunk, starting in the early teens and continuing throughout their shortened lives. They pop babies like machines and those children are born alcoholics and often abandoned to the streets and government garbage dumps to squander an existence on pure degradation. It is a sex destination for many in Asia as frolicking is cheap and without limits and very dangerous because of the cleaver entrapment mindset of the culture. Internally it is all smiles and joking and gouging with rice. Fat belly cops intimidate anyone they can, wrestling any peso they can from self administered 'law'. Men proudly urinate on the street as though a statement of their 'nature'. Women display their skin and bones babies outside the lavish malls of SM and Robinson's, the dominate players, an employment criteria of which you must be young and good looking and which malls sport a vast variety of Western Brands with prices far exceeding the same goods in the West. The non-tourists areas are scathing pagan-istic cultures where eyes watch from every direction to detect a source of advantage over another or one for gossip. The typical dwelling is a remnant of Spanish occupation, steel bars and concrete walls, little cages that lock up the monkeys at night. No one trusts anyone. A national phrase, \\\"never trust a Filipino\\\" echoes silently well beyond its 700 islands and many foreigners have fallen victim to their devious mindset. Albeit, there are many hellholes on earth, this is just one of the more tantalizing ones. For sure, if you send aid, whether money or goods, it will never reach those needing it. Just like the considerable money which sponsored the Manny Pacquiao\\/George Foreman in Vegas fight following the Yolanda super-typhoon event is rumored to have been squandered international relief funds.

O'Dell ruled this week against relief which would have allowed Crapser to remain in the United States, according to the Adoptee Rights Campaign . \nCrapser \u2014 who is the father of three young U.S. citizens \u2014 was adopted from Korea at age three, but because his adoptive parents never applied for naturalization, he is one of an estimated 35,000 intercountry adoptees who do not have U.S. citizenship and who can be deported to their country of birth \u2014 where they often do not speak the language, do not know the culture, and have no connections or family \u2014 for various minor crimes, according to advocates. \n\"Adam and his family are heartbroken at the outcome,\" Lori Walls of the Washington Immigration Defense Group, who is representing Crapser, told NBC News. \"He was eligible for a discretionary form of relief called 'cancellation of removal,' and the immigration judge decided he did not deserve this relief. Adam is desperate to be out of detention and waived appeal. He will be deported as soon as Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes the necessary arrangements.\" Adam Crapser as a child, born in South Korea and adopted by two American families who were physically and sexually abusive. Crapser is now at risk of being deported to South Korea for crimes committed in his youth because his adoptive parents did not naturalize him or give him the papers he needed to naturalize. Courtesy of Adam Crapser \n\"While I am disappointed in the judge's ruling and worried about my family's future, I hope that what has happened to me will further demonstrate the importance of passing the Adoptee Citizenship Act,\" Crapser said in a statement. \nThe Adoptee Citizenship Act of 2015 is a bill currently being considered by the U.S. Senate ( S.2275 ) and House of Representatives ( H.R.5454 ) that, if passed, would close a loophole in the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 , which automatically grants U.S. citizenship to children adopted by U.S. citizens, except for adoptees who were already over the age of 18 when the law passed in 2000. \nMany international adoptees who were not properly naturalized and also convicted of minor crimes have been deported to their country of birth, according to advocates. If passed, automatic retroactive citizenship would be granted to all international adoptees, and those who have been deported would be allowed to return to the U.S. \"We do not choose our families. But the U.S. does choose to bring adoptees into the U.S. with a promise of placing these children in safe homes to grow up like any other American.\" \n\"We are appalled by the unjust deportation of our friend and fellow adoptee who was adopted by U.S. citizens as a child and is a survivor of unspeakable abuse and trauma,\" Emily Kessel of the Adoptee Rights Campaign told NBC News. \"It is time for lawmakers to stop making excuses and pass legislation that will put an end to the deportation of Americans. Because that is what adoptees are. Americans.\" \nAdvocates for the bill argue that the bill gets at the heart of what it means to be a family and the promise of adoption. \n\"We do not choose our families,\" Kessel said. \"But the U.S. does choose to bring adoptees into the U.S. with a promise of placing these children in safe homes to grow up like any other American. Failing to grant citizenship to intercountry adoptees inhibits such individuals from fully contributing to our society and sends a negative message about our country. Adoptees are not disposable.

The current full fee waiver for applicants with household incomes under 150 percent of poverty guidelines will remain in effect. \n\"This new partial fee waiver, with the full waiver that has been in effect, will allow 3.7 million poor and working poor legal permanent residents to be able to become U.S. citizens and become full participants of our nation,\" Eva Millona, co-chair of the National Partnership for New Americans (NPNA) and executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, said in a statement. \"Citizenship should not be a privilege limited to the wealthy and highly educated. This is an important step forward for our democracy.\" Immigrants stand for the U.S. national anthem during a naturalization ceremony in the Great Hall of Ellis Island on September 16, in New York City. John Moore / Getty Images \nAdvocates for the partial waiver, including the NPNA and Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, praised the new rule, which reduces the naturalization fee for those eligible to $320. However, they had also urged USCIS expand the waiver to apply to household incomes beyond 200 percent of poverty guidelines. \n\"What we're seeing overall is that the partial waiver is a step in right direction,\" Nasim Khansari, citizenship project director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Los Angeles, told NBC News. \"We applaud USCIS for taking that step and making it more affordable.\" \nBut, Khansari added, \"if applicants make more than $48,600, they will be subject to the full fee increase. Even if it's a penny over that amount, they won't qualify.\" \nIn the United States, there are 8.5 million eligible-to-naturalize individuals, according to a USC Dornslife Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration brief that assessed the effects of the partial fee waiver. \nOf the one million who will be eligible for that waiver, the vast majority are Latino immigrants who are disproportionately of Mexican origin and account for 72 percent of those who qualify for the reduced naturalization fee. Mexicans are also disproportionately affected by the cost of citizenship. \nRELATED: Something in the Numbers: Citizen Applications at Highest in Four Years \nAbout 150,000 Asian immigrants, who account for 1.8 million of the nation's eligible-to-naturalize population, are also anticipated to benefit from the USCIS change. Among ethnic groups Advancing Justice-LA serves, it expects to see many working class Filipinos and Koreans \u2014 who often aren't eligible for the full waiver \u2014 qualify for the partial waiver, Khansari said. \nOthers expected to benefit are African lawful permanent residents, who make up over 275,000 of the eligible-to-naturalize population. Of that number, 85,000 are at or below 150 percent of poverty, and over 28,000 fall between 151 to 200 percent of poverty, according to the USC Dornslife report. \nWhile the partial waiver is good news for eligible-to-naturalize immigrants, it comes alongside increases in immigration application fees across the board. Among these include the standard naturalization fee, which will rise from $680 to $725. Changes will take effect on Dec. 23. \nRELATED: Naturalizations Backlog Could Keep Thousands of Immigrants From Voting \nWith more expensive fees, immigrants will likely choose not to apply for other certificates and petitions, Khansari said. The cost for a certificate of citizenship, for instance, nearly doubles from $600 to $1,170 in December. And the form to petition a relative increases from $420 to $535. \n\"If you have someone who becomes a U.S. citizen and wants to bring a family member, that fee is so high that it's going deter them from bringing them here,\" Khansari said. \nIndividuals who qualify for the reduced fee are encouraged by Advancing Justice-LA to submit their citizenship applications after the new rule goes into effect on Dec. 23, while eligible legal permanent residents who don't qualify for a partial fee waiver are encouraged to submit an application for citizenship before the fee increase goes into effect. \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Ceviche \nCeviche may sound odd to the uninitiated \u2014 after all, it's seafood that is not cooked with heat but with acid from citrus fruits such as limes. But there's a reason it's become popular, it's a delicious dish. There's some debate as to whether ceviche originated in pre-Colombian times with the fishermen who marinated their catch with indigenous fruits and peppers or the escabeches of medieval Spain that many of us ate growing up. But there's no question that the fusion of both culinary cultures along with the knowledge and technique that came with Japanese migration in the 19th century led to its perfection in Peru, though it's also popular in central American and Caribbean coastal regions.

(Photo by Roberto Machado Noa/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roberto Machado Noa / LightRocket via Getty Images \nThough South American cevicher\u00edas can be fairly casual, stateside ceviche is synonymous with the introduction of the more hyper-refined and complex Peruvian cuisine. World-class chefs like Gast\u00f3n Acurio have certainly helped propel and popularize this Peruvian classic in recent years. Arepas \nFor years you might have passed right by the bright yellow corn cakes oozing cheese onto a hot griddle at street fairs. But then arepa bars started popping up, offering the diversity of flavors and filling like reina pepiada, with seasoned chicken salad and avocado or the arepa domino, with black beans and guayan\u00e9s cheese. That's when everyone understood what their Venezuelan and Colombian friends had been enjoying all along. An arepa stuffed with chicken and avocado at Arepas Pues, which combines Colombia, Cuban and Venezuelan dishes, for the $20 Diner column on September, 19, 2016 in Washington, DC. Bill O'Leary / The Washington Post/Getty Images \nTraditionally made with cracked corn that has been peeled and ground, most arepas are now prepared with pre-cooked and dehydrated corn flour blended with water, salt, and oil. Deceptively simple, the trick is to add just enough water to make them easily moldable but not dry, creating the perfect blank canvas. Tacos \nIn his book Tacos, Tortas, and Tamales , Roberto Santiba\u00f1ez describes a taco as \"anything eaten on a soft tortilla\". It may seem like a simple statement, but if you're old enough to remember when tacos were largely sold as hard, deep fried shells, then you appreciate how far we've come in the United States. While the West coast could always boast of authentic and varied regional Mexican food, it took its time working its way east. TODAY Show: Siri Daly's recipe for roasted veggie tacos and strawberry salsa on TODAY, August 31, 2016 Nathan Congleton / TODAY \nThe establishment of thriving Mexican immigrant communities in major U.S. cities coupled with the food world's rising interest in all things Mexican, means you can now choose between following the taco trail in south Philly or hustling a reservation at the newest destination Mexican restaurant to open its doors in New York City or Chicago. You don't need a taco truck on every corner to understand we've barely scratched the surface of everything Mexican cuisine has to offer. The Cubano \nThe Cubano may be the quintessential crossover. There's even a question about whether it originated with Havana's sandwich mixto or was invented by the Cuban and Italian immigrants working in Tampa's cigar factories at the turn of the century, who added Genoa salami for added smoke and pork flavor. \nWhat isn't up for debate is that ham, roasted pork, swiss cheese, vinegary mustard and pickles pressed and melted between the perfect eggshell crust is magic. SILVER SPRING, MD - NYC's Best Cubano sandwich at A.G. Kitchen photographed in Silver Spring, MD. (Photo by Deb Lindsey For The Washington Post via Getty Images). The Washington Post/Getty Images \nWhile Cuban bread is hard to find outside of South Florida, a good baguette and enough butter on the grill will get you close enough. But stay way from the chipotle mayo and other embellishments. Too much heat throws off the delicate balance between the sweet, the sharp, and the savory. It may taste like a perfectly good sandwich, but it's best not to mess with the Cubano. \nRELATED: Hispanic Heritage Month: Meet the Rising Latino Food Stars Quinoa \nOnce an overlooked grain-like seed sold in health food specialty stores, quinoa's vitamin-packed profile loaded with protein and essential amino acids elevated it to superfood status.

Trump said Clinton wants to adopt single-payer healthcare. She's praised the Canadian system \u2014 as has Trump \u2014 but she's never said she wants to move to it. \"Hillary Clinton wants to really dismantle the Second Amendment,\" Trump said. She supports background checks for all gun purchases, not removing Americans' right to bear arms. \"She's also gonna raise your taxes big league, we're gonna lower your taxes,\" Trump claimed.

DAN HIMBRECHTS / EPA ", "latest posts from WHAT ARE THE FACTS? 4 hours ago Trump Claims Widespread 'Voter Fraud;' Data Says Otherwise \nAn investigation of 1 billion ballots cast over more than a decade found just 31 credible incidents of voter fraud. \nThe Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law found that \"it is more likely that an individual will be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls.\" Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day. Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on? So naive! Trump Misleads On Clinton's Support From Women \nDonald Trump tweeted Sunday that Hillary Clinton was down 11 points with women. \n\"Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43!\" he wrote. \nHowever, a closer look at the poll results indicate that Trump is misinterpreting Clinton's support among female voters. \nIn the ABC News/Washington Post poll that Trump referenced, Clinton actually leads by 8 points among women. She and Trump now run evenly among men, an unanticipated shift from polls taken at the end of September when Clinton had a 19-point advantage with women and Trump had a 19-point lead with men. The latest poll indicates that Trump has gained among white women without college degrees while Clinton has made inroads with white men. \nA new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll conducted entirely after the second presidential debate shows an even starker gender gap. Its findings indicate that Clinton holds a 20-point lead among female voters in a two-way race, 55 percent to 35 percent. Trump is ahead among men by only three points, 48 percent to 45 percent. Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43! 2 days ago Fact Check: No, Obama Isn't Flooding Streets with Drug Kingpins \n\"President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals. Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels,\" Donald Trump said on Saturday according to prepared remarks for his Portsmouth, New Hampshire speech. \nPresident Obama is not flooding the streets with drug kingpins, as Donald Trump alleges, and Hillary Clinton has not voiced support for doing anything similar. \nThe president has commuted the sentences of a record number of nonviolent drug offenders, like a 25-year-old convicted of selling LSD while following the Grateful Dead on tour and sentenced to life in prison. He will now be released in 2018. The commutations are designed to combat long, draconian, drug sentencing. \nSome with longer criminal records have benefited from Obama's policy, like one Miami dealer who oversaw several drug dealers and had weapons charges on this record. His sentence was reduced from life in prison to 30 years; he'll be released sometime after 2035. The White House says all applicants for commutation are evaluated \"to determine that an applicant is ready to make use of his or her second chance.\" \nLast year, the federal government \u2014 prompted not by Obama but an independent body that unanimously approved lowering sentencing charges \u2014 also released 6,000 prisoners convicted of drug-related charges released early after being deemed not to be a threat to society by judges. That's not tens of thousands, as Trump alleges, but the administration did say as many as 40,000 could become eligible for similar early release programs in the coming years. \nAs for his suggestion that these are \"illegal immigrants\" with cartel ties? All non-U.S. citizens (roughly one in three) face deportation or deportation hearings. 3 days ago Trump Ditched the Teleprompters \u2014 Here Are 6 Facts He Blurred \n1. \"Crooked Hillary is giving you a big tax increase, your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nThis is only true if Trump's crowd is full of rich folks: Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners. \n2. Clinton deleted emails \"to cover up her crimes.\" \nClinton deleted 33,000 emails, thousands of which were found on other servers. FBI Director James Comey said, \"We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\" \n3. \"I pay contractors on time, I am so good.\" \nHundreds of contractors including cabinet makers, dishwashers, waitresses and more have alleged that their bills were not paid. One such contractor, a piano manufacturer, said the quality of his work was never contested by the Trump Organization. They simply said they were \"short on funds\" and would only pay 70 percent of the bill. \n4. \"Murders in the United States are up 45 \u2014 did you see the numbers \u2014 the highest they've been in 45 years. Murder's the highest it's been in 45 years.\" \nIt's not, though the murder rate hike is at its highest point in 45 years. \n5. Trump said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency endorsed him. \nAgain: They did not; a union of some of their employees did. \n6. \"[The military has] fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where they're on display. They have to plane graveyards because they don't make the parts anymore. \" \nThere's some truth to Trump's statement. Politifact reached out to a range of third-party experts and found that some military jets are more than 20 years old. But that's not to say that the U.S. military doesn't invest in new planes for its forces. What Trump Got Right and Wrong On Friday \nHere's what Trump got wrong, and right, in his Friday afternoon speech. \n1. \"Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nUnless Trump's crowd is filled with extremely wealthy Americans, their taxes will not go \"way down.\" \nThe wealthy would see the biggest tax cut under Trump's plan, according to the conservative Tax Foundation's analysis. The bottom 80% of Americans, would see 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent more after-tax income thanks to Trump's tax cuts. The richest 1 percent of Americans would see income gains between 10 percent and 16 percent. \n2. \"Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep, but really she's just resting.\" \nIt's true that Clinton doesn't have any publicly scheduled events until after the debate, but there is no evidence she is napping. She prepares at length: For a previous debate , Clinton hunkered down in hotels near her home for day-long sessions of debate prep with her advisors, often working until very late at night. \n3. \"Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress\u2026and she said get rid of 'em, delete 'em, bleach 'em, nobody bleaches because it's such an expensive process, she bleaches them, and then she made everyone get rid of iPhones, hammer them.\" \nClinton requested that 33,000 emails deemed personal by her team be deleted weeks before the Congressional subpoena; she did not stop their deletion, but it was not a direct response to the subpoena. She did not use an expensive process to delete her emails. She used a free app called BleachBit. Some of her mobile phones were destroyed with a hammer, but that was also not a response to the Congressional subpoena. \n4. Trump said Qatar gave $1 million dollars for \"Bill Clinton's birthday party.\" \nThe Emirate gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million dollars as a birthday present; that money went towards charitable acts, not festivities. \n5. \"WikiLeaks shows media conspires with the campaign, including giving the questions and answers before the debate.\" \nCNN and DNC Chair Donna Brazile deny that a debate question was ever given to the Clinton campaign, though an email does appear to show a question being offered up by Brazile to the Clinton campaign. \n6. \"I have no idea who these women are,\" Trump said of the women who have come forward to accuse him of improper sexual advances and groping. \nThis has become a routine denial for Trump, but months before he started denying he knew a Miss Utah who accused him of kissing her on the lips without consent, he argued that she'd personally recanted the story and that she was a \"nice girl.\" \n7. \"Biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\" ", "latest posts from WHAT ARE THE FACTS? 2 hours ago No, the Presidential Election Will Not Be the Next 'Brexit' for Pollsters \nMonths after voters in the United Kingdom defied surveys and chose to leave the European Union \u2014 after pollsters had widely predicted the country would remain \u2014 Donald Trump is betting on the American electorate delivering another polling surprise. \n\"Believe me, this is Brexit times five,\" Trump said in Pennsylvania last week. \nBut experts say a polling upset on November 8th is incredibly unlikely, and that the Brexit comparison just doesn't hold water. 4 hours ago Trump Cites Police, Military, ICE Endorsements That Didn't Happen \nOn Monday, Donald Trump told News4Jax that the United States military \"conceptually\" endorsed him and that \"virtually every police department\" in the country backed his bid for the presidency. During last week's third debate, Trump said his hardline stance on immigration and pledge to build a border wall had earned him an endorsement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. a day ago Trump Claims Media Isn't Asking Kaine About Catholics. They Are \nTrump asked on Twitter why Vice Presidential nominee Tim Kaine, a practicing Catholic, was not being asked about the hacked WikiLeaks emails that appear to show Clinton campaign staffers mocking Catholicism. \nKaine has been asked about them in nearly every national TV interview he's done in the last week. \nHe was asked about this twice last Sunday ABC's This Week and Fox News Sunday , CNBC two days later , and was pressed on the same issue on NBC News' Meet the Press yesterday. Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win! 2 days ago No, ISIS Isn't Rooting for Clinton \nISIS is \"dreaming that Hillary Clinton becomes President. ISIS, their number one dream, Hillary Clinton, let her become President. She's the one that allowed it to form, she's the one that watched it go, now they say it's in 32 countries, worse than ever.\"A dozen interviews with ISIS extremists and a review of their social media networks by Foreign Affairs magazine found that the terrorist group has a strong preference in the 2016 election: they'd like to see Donald Trump elected, not Clinton. \nFact checkers have also reviewed Trump's repeated claim that ISIS' rise is directly Clinton's fault and declared it to be false . 3 days ago Trump Cites Pew Study as Proof of Fraud, But Study Doesn't Find It \n\"According to the highly respected Pew, there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate ... There are 1.8 million dead people that are registered right now to vote. And folks, folks, some of them vote,\" Trump said Saturday night while calling the election \"rigged.\" \nThis 2012 Pew study notes that the voter rolls are wildly out of date and advocates for modernizing the system to save taxpayer money. It finds no proof of voter fraud; the study's only mention of voter fraud is merely that error-riddled voter logs lead to the \"perception\" of being susceptible to fraud. \nIn practice, experts say widespread voter fraud just doesn't exist. Poll observers say that if a voter moves to another state or dies, they don't vote twice and aren't likely to be impersonated. A Loyola researcher who reviewed a billion ballots found 31 credible cases of voter fraud . 4 days ago Yup, the Investor's Business Daily Poll Was the Most Accurate in 2012 \nDonald Trump likes to blur the polls. He's boasted of winning ones that didn't exist, and earlier this week he said he'd won every single post-debate online tally \u2014 not true, since our own NBC News/Survey Monkey showed Hillary Clinton winning and even Breitbart's survey said the same for a time \u2014 so when Trump started talking up the credentials of a lesser-known poll, our fact checker's ear was piqued. \n\"We're leading in three recent polls the last day: Rasmussen, LA Times, Investor's Business Daily. The last one was the most accurate poll of the last cycle, so that's a good sign!\" he said. \nSure enough, Trump's spot on here: Investor's Business Daily was indeed the most accurate poll of 2012 among the more prolific pollsters. He's leading Clinton by just one point in the national poll of 789 likely voters \u2014 within the margin of error to be sure \u2014 but leading nonetheless. No, the World Doesn't Hate Obama and America \n\"The world hates our president, and the world hates us.\" Trump 10/21/2016 \nTrump repeatedly said the U.S. is run by \"babies\" and \"losers\" today, deriding the president and his wife who have campaigned for his rival at length. But his claim that the world hates President Barack Obama, and the U.S. in general, is false. \n\"Barack Obama continues to enjoy a broad degree of international popularity,\" a Pew Global report found this summer, noting particularly strong popularity in Europe and Asia. The Middle East, where the U.S. is still involved militarily, has lower favorability ratings for the U.S. What's more, the U.S. isn't poorly viewed: a median of 69% view the U.S. favorably, with 24 percent expressing an unfavorable view in another Pew Global study from last year. 4 days ago Trump Claims Michelle Obama Dissed Hillary Clinton in '08 Primary. She Didn't. \n\"We have a bunch of babies running our country, folks. We have a bunch of losers. They're losers. They're babies. We have a president, all he wants to do is campaign. His wife, all she wants to do is campaign. And I see how much his wife likes Hillary, but wasn't she the one that originally started the statement, 'If you can't take care of your home,' right? 'You can't take care of the White House or the country.' Where's that? I don't hear that. I don't hear that. She's the one that started that. I said, 'We can't say that. It's too vicious.' Can you believe it? I said that. We can't say it. They said, 'Well, Michelle Obama said it.' I said, 'She did?' Now she said that, but we don't hear about that.\" Trump, 10/21/2016 \nIn the 2008 Democratic primary, Michelle Obama spoke about her own family while campaigning for her husband in Chicago: \"One of the things, the important aspects of this race, is role modeling what good families should look like. And my view is that if you can't run your own house, you certainly can't run the White House. Can't do it.\" \nMrs. Obama made similar remarks at a campaign stop in Iowa, talking about the importance of family and how she and Barack Obama managed their careers with raising kids. When those comments were interpreted at a swipe at Clinton, the then-Illinois senator denied that they had anything to do with President Bill Clinton's notorious infidelities. \nTrump made a similar claim in the second debate , suggesting that Mrs. Obama's words had been used as a campaign ad in the 2008 primary. They weren't. The only campaign ad that's used those words are a pro-Trump ad cut by a super PAC this year. 5 days ago Trump Says Clinton Team Promoting Voter Fraud \n\"John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman, was quoted in WikiLeaks saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have their driver's license,\" Donald Trump said Thursday, prompting his Delaware crowd to roar angrily. \nOnly Podesta didn't say that. \nIn an email chain about voter ID and voter registration, allegedly from Podesta's personal email account that was hacked and published on WikiLeaks, Podesta appears to suggest that photo ID for same-day registration might be a good way to for them to combat GOP-supported voter ID laws. \nPodesta said voters would need to attest to their citizenship to do so -- something you do any time you register to vote -- he doesn't suggest undocumented immigrants lie in order to register to vote. \nThe conversation is rooted in hypotheticals: one person suggests supporting online voting, another suggests online voter registration. This wasn't campaign scheming as Trump alleges, this was an informal discussion. 6 days ago We Fact Checked the Whole Debate. Here's What We Found. \nIn their third and final debate, the two candidates didn't disappoint our ready and waiting fact check team at NBC News and PolitiFact. In a wild 90-minute debate, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton brought up dozens of inaccuracies, half truths, and a few surprising truths. ", "advertisement \nWith just two weeks to go before the general election, community nonprofits have been hard at work making sure Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) voters head to the polls on Nov. 8. \nFrom phone banks to door knocking, from festivals to townhalls, nonpartisan organizations serving AAPI communities across the country are leaving nothing to chance, voter outreach workers tell NBC News. And it's not just the presidential contest that is driving these efforts. The results of local, state, and federal elections, they say, also matter since they stand to shape the political landscape in coming years. \nTo that end, the AAPI electorate, which accounts for roughly five percent of voters nationwide, could make a difference in battleground states, including Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Depending on turnout, they could also end up being the margin of victory in some states for either Republican nominee Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California. Post by NBC News . \nAnd with all 435 House seats up for grabs, AAPIs might tip the results of elections in 103 congressional districts, in which they account for at least five percent of the electorate . That includes Washington's 7th District , a race between Indian-American Pramila Jayapal and Brady Walkinshaw, both Democrats, and Illinois' 8th District , with Indian-American Raja Krishnamoorthi facing off against Republican Pete DiCianni. \nKrishnamoorthi and DiCianni are vying for the seat held by Asian-American U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Il), who is running for Senate. \n\"It looks like this will probably be a record year in terms of AAPIs getting elected to Congress, and particularly in the South Asian community,\" Ramakrishnan told NBC News. A new AARP report finds the economic health of Asian Americans age 65 and older to be much worse than the general US population of the same age. LOU DEMATTEIS / REUTERS \nBut while voter outreach workers and volunteers say the fiery political rhetoric of this campaign season has spurred many AAPIs to register to vote, apathy still exists among others who feel their votes might not matter. \nBoth major parties and the candidates' campaigns have been making efforts to win over AAPIs, realizing that the fastest growing racial group in the U.S . could help decide elections across the country. \nRELATED: Asian-American Population Surges, But Voter Turnout Still Lacks \nHaving seen AAPI support steadily wane since the 1992 presidential election, when 55 percent of Asians voted for former President George H. W. Bush, the GOP last year launched its Republican Leadership Initiative , designed to recruit and train grassroots organizers in AAPI communities. In July, the Trump campaign also formed an Asian Pacific American (APA) advisory committee, which met for the first time a day before the third and final debate in Las Vegas. Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump meeting with members of Chinese Americans for Trump on June 3 in Beverly Hills, California. Courtesy of Tian Wang \nSome members of Trump's APA advisory committee, including Chinese Americans for Trump founder Tian (David) Wang and Asian Action Network president Herman Martir, told NBC News they've been knocking on doors and handing out literature about Trump and the GOP in swing states like Nevada, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. \nNBC News reached out multiple times by phone and email to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee for additional information on AAPI voter outreach efforts as Election Day nears, but did not receive a response. \nRELATED: Clinton Holds 41-Point Lead Over Trump Among Asian-American Voters: Survey \nHillary Clinton's campaign told NBC News that the Democratic nominee is not taking a single vote for granted \u2014 even as she enjoys solid support among Asian-American registered voters, leading Trump by 41 points , according to a report released in October. \n\"The only poll that matters to us is the one on November 8,\" said Jason Tengco, Clinton's AAPI outreach director. d meeting all the @HillaryClinton volunteers in NV! Great talks about amazing AAPI girls&youth&growth&empowerment pic.twitter.com/K170FSOt0K \u2014 Constance Wu (@ConstanceWu) October 9, 2016 \nTengco said Clinton's team has been shoring up the AAPI base in Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, which running mate Tim Kaine represents in the U.S. Senate. All of these are or were battleground states, some of them with local races that can go either way. \nIn addition to door knocking and phone banking, Clinton's campaign has deployed celebrity surrogates like actress Constance Wu and comedian Margaret Cho, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), to help register AAPIs at Las Vegas's Chinatown Plaza to vote, Tengco said. \nHer campaign has also been publicizing locations in Las Vegas where voters can cast ballots early, including at Seafood City Market, an Asian supermarket, and Chinatown Plaza, Tengco said. AAPIs make up almost nine percent of eligible voters in Clark County, according to APIAVote, which includes Las Vegas. \nMeanwhile, Clinton volunteers from New York and New Jersey, two blue states, have been trekking on weekends to the battleground state of Pennsylvania to reach out to AAPI voters, Tengco said. Volunteers bus from New York and New Jersey to Pennsylvania to stump for Hillary Clinton . Courtesy of the Office of Grace Meng \nIn mid October, U.S. Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) and 35 others took a bus from New York to Philadelphia, a city where nearly five percent of the eligible electorate is AAPI. Volunteers went door-to-door speaking with voters not just about the presidential election, but also about federal contests, Tengco said, including the close Senate race between Democrat Katie McGinty and incumbent Republican Pat Toomey. \nTo gain control of the Senate, Democrats would have to win four seats if they take the White House (because the vice president gets to break a 50-50 tie) and five seats if they don't. \nIn Ohio, Tengco said Clinton's campaign has been using bilingual speakers and voter lists broken down by AAPI language to target specific voters. And in the DC, Maryland and Virginia area, AAPI for Hillary groups have been hosting phone banks and canvassing for votes, he added. Efforts have focused particularly on northern Virginia, given its diverse AAPI population, including Koreans, Vietnamese, and Indians, among others, he said. \"The challenge has always been getting people to understand that they have a right to vote, that you're not going to be intimidated as a result of it.\" \nBut Ramakrishnan, the public policy professor, said both parties are not doing enough to reach out to AAPIs \u2014 a demographic, he noted, that is less likely to be contacted by either Democrats or Republicans. And while community organizations are trying to pick up the slack, Ramakrishnan said they are outmatched compared to the parties and campaigns in terms of resources at their disposal. \n\"Historically, foundations have not invested nearly as much in AAPI voter education and outreach as they have in other communities of color,\" Ramakrishnan said. \nThat underinvestment, he said, stems from a lack of awareness of AAPI communities among foundation program officers. Other contributing factors include perceptions that the AAPI community is not large enough and that it doesn't need assistance because AAPIs are highly educated and have high incomes, a reflection of the model minority myth, Ramakrishnan said. \nA Community Effort \nIn spite of this, nonpartisan community groups across the U.S. have been making an all-out effort to meet with AAPIs, register new voters, and stress the importance of casting ballots on Election Day. Voter outreach workers say they hope for an improvement over the last presidential election in 2012, when roughly three in five eligible Asian-American voters were registered to vote, according to the U.S. Census , and one in two reported actually heading to the polls on Election Day. \nLooking to help beef up those numbers, nonprofit APIAVote in Ohio partnered in late September with the Vietnamese Student Association at The Ohio State University in Columbus to sign up new voters, Tina Maharath, APIAVote Ohio field fellow, told NBC News. \nBut voting can be a tough sell for millennials, she said. Post by NBC News . \nThat day, Maharath said they registered six people since most of the 80 who attended were already signed up. One way she said she tries to motivate Southeast Asians is by reminding them that some of their ancestors came to America by way of refugee camps and may not have had the opportunity to register to vote. \n\"I have to drill it down to where it gets them deep in the heart,\" Maharath said. \"Otherwise, they won't even pay any attention to me.\" \nA lack of interest in politics is another obstacle for outreach workers like Maharath. In Ohio, part of the problem on the local level, she said, is that candidates don't mention AAPIs in their speeches and generally don't do enough to engage AAPI voters. \nFrom 2008 to 2012, the number of eligible AAPI voters grew in Ohio by 18.6 percent, according to APIAVote. \n\"It really brings me down when I'm trying to get them in the political process,\" she said. Post by NBC News . \nOut in the West, efforts in Utah have also been underway to turn out the state's Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander electorate on Election Day. While Asians make up just 2.5 percent of Utah's total population, according to the Census, the proportion of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders living in Salt Lake City \u2014 the state capital \u2014 is larger than any other city in the continental U.S ., according to the Utah Department of Health. \nLavinia Taumoepeau-Latu, director of civic engagement for the National Tongan American Society (NTAS), a Utah nonprofit, told NBC News her organization has been creating a space to discuss issues important to the state's Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community, including healthcare, education, and racial profiling in schools. \nDuring the last couple of months, NTAS helped organize a town hall with candidates for local office and filmed public service announcements in the Tongan, Samoan, and English languages with Pacific Islanders discussing the importance of voting, Taumoepeau-Latu said. In August, NTAS also hosted the Friendly Island Tongan Festival, a three-day event now in its twentieth year that was attended by 1,200 people. \nThe group signed up around 100 new voters, while local candidates set up campaign booths to meet face-to-face with members of the Pacific Islander community, Taumoepeau-Latu said. \nAt the end of October, NTAS will also conduct phone banking to follow up with registered voters and may also hold training on how to read a ballot, she said. \nBut despite the group's best efforts, Taumoepeau-Latu added, challenges still remain. \n\"When we deal with our communities, it's a little bit different because a lot of them have voter apathy, a lot of them don't really understand the whole process of getting civically engaged,\" she said. \"Some of them have been here for a long time, which makes it really difficult to explain how important their voice matters.\" Play ", "advertisement \nJaylen Bledsoe is a millionaire at age 17 and credits a technology program for gifted third graders at his St. Louis school for his remarkable success. \nBledsoe taught himself web design in sixth grade after taking a yearbook design class.

Play ", "advertisement \nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite of Florida's voters of Puerto Rican descent, who say they'll be turning out to vote this year, according to a first of its kind poll. \nAbout three quarters of those polled said they would vote for Clinton compared to 17 percent for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. \nThe poll also found strong turnout is likely among the Sunshine State's Puerto Ricans, whose numbers have swelled to more than 1 million. \nEighty-four percent said they will definitely vote and 14 percent said they will likely vote or are uncertain whether they'd vote. Only 2 percent said they wouldn't vote. epa05438607 A supporter holds a Puerto Rican and a US flag with a sign as she awaits the arrival of US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her Vice Presidential candidate Senator Tim Kaine during a campaign stop at Florida International University in Miami, Florida, USA, 23 July 2016. EPA/RHONA WISE RHONA WISE / EPA \nBut the Florida Puerto Ricans' bend toward Democrats is less certain down ballot. The vote was almost evenly split between Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American seeking a return to the Senate, and his Democratic opponent Patrick Murphy. \nForty-four percent said they'd vote for Murphy and 42 percent supported Rubio. Seven percent were undecided. \nThe poll was conducted by Latino Decisions for the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund . \nThe Puerto Rican population boom in Florida makes it possible for the deeper probe of the political preferences and behavior of Puerto Ricans in the swing state. The population has been growing for years, but took off more recently as Puerto Ricans relocated from the recession-wracked island to find jobs. \n\"I think the most important thing is that we even have the information,\" said Sylvia Manzano, a principal at Latino Decisions. This is the first time a poll specifically focuses on the state's growing numbers of Puerto Rican voters. \nThe political focus on Latinos in Florida has been \"for a long time on Cuban Americans, but now there is recognition Puerto Ricans are a sizable share of the electorate. The fact we have this information is just a gem in itself,\" said Manzano said. \nNot only do Puerto Ricans' numbers in Florida rival New York's Puerto Rican population, but they've also signaled a potential shift in Puerto Rican political influence within the state, which is considered a crucial battleground state. \nRELATED: Puerto Ricans Flex Their Political Muscle in Florida \nFlorida's Cuban Americans have been a reliably Republican voting electorate for years, although that has been changing and there has been more of a partisan and generational split in recent elections. \nDespite their overwhelming preference for Clinton, only about 37 percent of Puerto Ricans polled said they had been contacted by a campaign, political party or community organization and asked to support their candidate or register to vote. \nIn a separate poll released last month and also conducted by Latino Decisions, 47 percent of all Latinos in Florida said they had had such contact. \nManzano said the poll's findings show that this is a ripe electorate for Democrats, but that the party needs to find them. \n\"They can take nothing for granted when the margins are this narrow. They should be talking to their base,\" she said. \nOther findings from the poll: Even though Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and don't have to worry about deportation, those polled said immigration was the third most important issue facing Puerto Ricans and Latinos that politicians should address. The top issue was jobs/economy and No. 2 was health care. Puerto Ricans born on the island preferred Murphy in the Senate race over Rubio, 46 percent to 37 percent, while Puerto Ricans born on the mainland were evenly split, 40 percent to 40 percent. Rubio sought the GOP presidential nomination but bowed out after failing to win his home state in the primary. More than half of the Florida Puerto Ricans polled, whether born on the island or on the mainland, said that when they vote, they consider a candidate's views on Puerto Rico and issues on the island. Of those born on the island, 61 percent said they took those views into account; among those born on the mainland it was 46 percent. \n\"People don't think of Puerto Rican voters as considering homeland politics. People think of Cubans in that way,\" Manzano said. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

The commutations are designed to combat long, draconian, drug sentencing. \nSome with longer criminal records have benefited from Obama's policy, like one Miami dealer who oversaw several drug dealers and had weapons charges on this record. His sentence was reduced from life in prison to 30 years; he'll be released sometime after 2035. The White House says all applicants for commutation are evaluated \"to determine that an applicant is ready to make use of his or her second chance.\" \nLast year, the federal government \u2014 prompted not by Obama but an independent body that unanimously approved lowering sentencing charges \u2014 also released 6,000 prisoners convicted of drug-related charges released early after being deemed not to be a threat to society by judges. That's not tens of thousands, as Trump alleges, but the administration did say as many as 40,000 could become eligible for similar early release programs in the coming years. \nAs for his suggestion that these are \"illegal immigrants\" with cartel ties? All non-U.S. citizens (roughly one in three) face deportation or deportation hearings. 3 days ago Trump Ditched the Teleprompters \u2014 Here Are 6 Facts He Blurred \n1. \"Crooked Hillary is giving you a big tax increase, your taxes will go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nThis is only true if Trump's crowd is full of rich folks: Under Trump's plan, the conservative Tax Foundation expects that the bottom 80 percent of Americans will see just 0.8 percent to 1.8 percent more income after his tax cuts. Clinton's plan will only increase taxes for America's wealthiest earners. \n2. Clinton deleted emails \"to cover up her crimes.\" \nClinton deleted 33,000 emails, thousands of which were found on other servers. FBI Director James Comey said, \"We found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.\" \n3. \"I pay contractors on time, I am so good.\" \nHundreds of contractors including cabinet makers, dishwashers, waitresses and more have alleged that their bills were not paid. One such contractor, a piano manufacturer, said the quality of his work was never contested by the Trump Organization. They simply said they were \"short on funds\" and would only pay 70 percent of the bill. \n4. \"Murders in the United States are up 45 \u2014 did you see the numbers \u2014 the highest they've been in 45 years. Murder's the highest it's been in 45 years.\" \nIt's not, though the murder rate hike is at its highest point in 45 years. \n5. Trump said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency endorsed him. \nAgain: They did not; a union of some of their employees did. \n6. \"[The military has] fighter jets that are so old that they have to go to museums where they're on display. They have to plane graveyards because they don't make the parts anymore. \" \nThere's some truth to Trump's statement. Politifact reached out to a range of third-party experts and found that some military jets are more than 20 years old. But that's not to say that the U.S. military doesn't invest in new planes for its forces. What Trump Got Right and Wrong On Friday \nHere's what Trump got wrong, and right, in his Friday afternoon speech. \n1. \"Your taxes go way down under a Trump administration.\" \nUnless Trump's crowd is filled with extremely wealthy Americans, their taxes will not go \"way down.\" \nThe wealthy would see the biggest tax cut under Trump's plan, according to the conservative Tax Foundation's analysis. The bottom 80% of Americans, would see 0.8 percent to 1.9 percent more after-tax income thanks to Trump's tax cuts. The richest 1 percent of Americans would see income gains between 10 percent and 16 percent. \n2. \"Crooked Hillary is doing no more public events until after the debate. They say she's doing debate prep, but really she's just resting.\" \nIt's true that Clinton doesn't have any publicly scheduled events until after the debate, but there is no evidence she is napping. She prepares at length: For a previous debate , Clinton hunkered down in hotels near her home for day-long sessions of debate prep with her advisors, often working until very late at night. \n3. \"Hillary bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. She got a subpoena from Congress\u2026and she said get rid of 'em, delete 'em, bleach 'em, nobody bleaches because it's such an expensive process, she bleaches them, and then she made everyone get rid of iPhones, hammer them.\" \nClinton requested that 33,000 emails deemed personal by her team be deleted weeks before the Congressional subpoena; she did not stop their deletion, but it was not a direct response to the subpoena. She did not use an expensive process to delete her emails. She used a free app called BleachBit. Some of her mobile phones were destroyed with a hammer, but that was also not a response to the Congressional subpoena. \n4. Trump said Qatar gave $1 million dollars for \"Bill Clinton's birthday party.\" \nThe Emirate gave the Clinton Foundation $1 million dollars as a birthday present; that money went towards charitable acts, not festivities. \n5. \"WikiLeaks shows media conspires with the campaign, including giving the questions and answers before the debate.\" \nCNN and DNC Chair Donna Brazile deny that a debate question was ever given to the Clinton campaign, though an email does appear to show a question being offered up by Brazile to the Clinton campaign. \n6. \"I have no idea who these women are,\" Trump said of the women who have come forward to accuse him of improper sexual advances and groping. \nThis has become a routine denial for Trump, but months before he started denying he knew a Miss Utah who accused him of kissing her on the lips without consent, he argued that she'd personally recanted the story and that she was a \"nice girl.\" \n7. \"Biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan.\" ", "Oct 19 2016, 5:43 pm ET As Early Childcare Needs Take Focus, Immigrant Workers Left Without Opportunity by Janine Wolf American children are increasingly coming from immigrant backgrounds, but low wages and few pathways to advancement are pushing multilingual childcare workers out of the field.

Born in Boston, his upbringing forged a deep bond with the community in and beyond the city's Chinatown, where he currently works as the executive director of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, the largest social service provider for Asian families in the Greater Boston area. \"If implementing higher standards you are unintentionally pushing immigrant and other underrepresented providers out of the workforce.

Additional training and education that would allow such workers to meet new standards is also lacking, according to a report from the Migration Policy Institute (MPI). \n\"If implementing higher standards you are unintentionally pushing immigrant and other underrepresented providers out of the workforce,\" Li told NBC News. \"That's not good for children.\" Sorry Adult Ed, but Acorn Center for Early Education is the cutest graduation ceremony at @BCNCInc this month! pic.twitter.com/nHPAm1evSl \u2014 Giles Li (@GilesLiBCNC) June 24, 2016 \nAs of 2015, one in four of the nation's 23 million children under age 6 were born to immigrant parents, according to the MPI (MPI). The growth in diversity among the young-child population \u2014 with a doubling of those with an immigrant parent from 2.9 million in 1990 to 5.8 million in 2015 \u2014 has been accompanied by increasingly diverse ECEC workers. \nNationally, close to 1.8 million people are employed in the ECEC workforce, according to the MPI. Of them, immigrants make up 18 percent, or approximately 321,000, of all ECEC workers. Post by NBC News . \nHistorically, the low barrier of entry into many early-childhood care and education positions has been beneficial to immigrant workers with less formal education, according to the MPI. However, the growing shift of focus on quality has resulted in immigrant being stuck in the lowest-paying jobs. \nIn 2015, 22 percent of immigrant ECEC workers made below the poverty line, the MPI found. In Massachusetts, where the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center operates, the average annual income is for an ECEC worker is $32,000 \u2014 just $9,000 higher than the federal poverty level. \n\"Without well-designed education and training support to make advanced credentials more accessible, policies that raise the education requirements for entry and advancement in the field may indirectly result in reduced diversity in the workforce, given the high proportion of immigrant workers who are [limited English proficient] or have low education levels,\" the MPI report reads. A chart, taken from a 2016 Department of Education report, showing the average hourly salary of ECEC workers. \nKathy Cheng, director of BCNC's Acorn Center for Early Education and Care, said the center has seen a lot of directors and teachers leaving for higher paying jobs, saying it's \"not because they want to do it but because they have to.\" \nThe struggle to find high-quality childcare caused by low wages has drawn the attention of the White House, which has proposed a $75 billion expansion of a federal program that would increase the funding of preschool programs for children of low- to moderate-income families. \"Without well-designed education and training ... policies that raise the education requirements for entry and advancement in the field may indirectly result in reduced diversity in the workforce.\" \nThe U.S. Department of Education found that high-quality providers and educators are the single most important factors in these early childhood experiences. \nStudies by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that children in high-quality care are happier and perform better on social and cognitive measures, though \"less than 10 percent\" of child care arrangements actually meet those standards. \n\"It's important,\" Li said. \"It shouldn't be a field that is looked at as a stepping stone to public schools.\" \nIn the future, he hopes for a more holistic approach to policy-making, one that takes both ECEC workers and the children impacted into account. \n\"I'd hope moving forward there's an active effort to engage communities like ours in the decision making,\" he said. \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Clinton's running mate Tim Kaine needled Indiana Gov. Mike Pence with Trump's labeling Mexicans as rapists, while Pence pushed criticisms that Clinton is a proponent of open borders and amnesty. \nWhat has been more enduring from that discussion was Pence's dismissal of Kaine's goading, which immediately became a Twitter hashtag, #ThatMexicanThing, Again. \nRelated: #ThatMexicanThing: Kaine Needles Pence Over Trump's Comments \nBut generally there's not been a lot of depth on the issue for the public at large. \nLazaro Zamora, a senior policy analyst for the Bipartisan Policy Center , said the two candidates need to \"let go of generalizations\" and the kind of rhetoric that surrounds immigration and put forth details on how either will get a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform. \n\"Both promised to do a lot, probably more than a lot of people who have been dealing with this issue and actually administratively putting in play the plans,\" said Zamora. \"Hopefully (debate moderator) Chris Wallace can push on specifics,\" Zamora said. \nNevada is an apt place for the candidates to get to the nitty gritty of immigration. About one in five Nevadans are foreign born, nearly half of whom are naturalized citizens eligible to vote, according to the American Immigration Council . \nIt would be a serious omission were Clinton not to remind debate viewers that she started her campaign back in May 2015 by meeting with young immigrants without legal status known as DREAMers. \nShe's since put DREAMERs on staff and made a touching commercial from a meeting with immigrant families in Nevada in which a young girl tells her of her fear her parents will be deported. \nRelated: Clinton ad with Latina Girl Hits Emotional Issue of Deportations \nThere and in other points in the campaign, Clinton has moved or been forced to move left on immigration, sometimes even to the left of President Barack Obama. She had to rethink an early view supporting turning back Central American children arriving at the U.S. border and pledging not to deport anyone who is not a criminal or a terrorist. Dozens protested outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Phoenix hours after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a 4-4 ruling over President Obama's immigration plan. Griselda Nevarez \nBut Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said the immigration discussion is no longer about whether Clinton needs to move left. Based on polling showing American support for immigration reform, she now can say \"we have the opportunity to say that as Americans we believe all immigrants, regardless of status, should be treated as human beings.\" \n\"I think there's a lot more she can do, but it's not about left versus right, it's about the overwhelming majority of Americans valuing immigrants and immigration,\" Noorani said. \nClinton will have some ground to stand on with that stance. Just as the two candidate's highly divergent views could be on display to national television and online audiences, a Fox News poll shows the American public doesn't share the same divide. \nZamora tweeted early today on some findings on immigration in a Fox News poll released Tuesday.

The basis for these differing strategies boils down to what it takes to win the presidency. \nEveryone can agree that elections are a numbers game. More votes equals a win, pretty plain and simple. But where it gets tricky is the path to that win. \nRELATED: Debate Was Short On Immigration, But #BadHombres Was Trending \nFor the last 15 or 20 years the Republican Party has recognized that they need to open up the partisan tent and bring in more voters. Until recently, one of the groups the GOP had been targeting was Latinos. \nIn the past, the diverse Hispanic electorate had proven friendly to Republican candidates. For example in 2004, George W. Bush won upwards of 40 percent of the Latino vote. \nIn 2013 on the heels of Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama, the GOP produced an autopsy report. In recounting what went wrong and setting out how to fix it, the main takeaway was essentially this: Don't insult and alienate Latinos \u2014 we need them!

Win McNamee / Getty Images \nBut enter Donald Trump, who took a completely different path to primary victory. Instead of broadening the Republican coalition, he subscribed to an alternate theory \u2014 bring back disenchanted white voters into the fold. Forget the big tent, just build a beautiful wall. \nThis idea was first laid out in 2013 by Real Clear Politics' Sean Trende . In \"The Case of the Missing White Voters, Revisited\" Trende summarizes his research that lays out how the GOP could win the presidency by boosting the numbers of white voters that have been in decline. \nRELATED: 'Game Over, Donald': Our Latino Panel Rates the Debate \nTrende points out how the most salient demographic change was in the number of white voters from 2008 to 2012.

Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (R) speaks as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump looks on during the third U.S. presidential debate. Mark Ralston / Pool via Getty Images \nTrump took Trende's theory to heart. Rather than reach out to minorities he decided to double down on white voters. \nMore specifically, he implemented a divide-and-conquer strategy to win the presidency. Trump has drawn on the economic frustrations and worries of working-class whites and spun them toward the blaming of the \"other\" \u2014 especially immigrant Latinos. \nTrump's recipe for victory rested on low Latino turnout and anger-boosted white turnout. Or in Trump talk - he was hoping the bad hombres wouldn't turn out and the disenchanted white turnout would be huge, or \"yuuge.\" . \nThe election is not over yet. Until then we can't definitively say whether the \"big tent\" or the \"divide and conquer\" strategy was the best for the GOP. \nOne thing's more certain. Even in the off chance that the divide and conquer strategy wins this time around, the reality is that it's demographically unsustainable. \nNumbers don't lie and the demographic reality is that \"the\" Latinos are here to stay and only growing in size.

However, the discussion went awry quickly, and will probably only be remembered for Trump calling undocumented immigrants \"bad hombres.\" Kudos to Clinton for pointing out that many undocumented immigrants likely pay more in federal income taxes than Trump does. \nNone of this mattered. The only takeaway from this debate - for Latinos and all Americans - is that the nominee of a major political party does not have faith in our elections. \nThis is wholly unprecedented. \nTo anyone who may have had doubts about Clinton and her judgment at times , this should be a wake-up call.

Trump Has Reached a Breaking Point in our National Discussion About Women Celeste Montoya Celeste Montoya / Celeste Montoya \nAfter the last train wreck of a debate, Wednesday's focus on policy, at least initially, was refreshing. As a policy wonk, I want to dig in, but we are beyond that moment. Instead, we are in the unfortunate position of questioning a candidate's commitment to democracy and a basic respect for human dignity. \nOn the former, we have heard a candidate who apparently cannot lose unless the system is rigged. He has fanned the flames of voter fraud myths, calling not only for the surveillance and intimidation at the polls that were a mainstay of the Jim Crow-era, but also invoking the possibility of rebellion, rejecting a fundamental element of democracy; the peaceful transfer of power. Tonight he refused to commit to the very basic principal that he would respect the will of the people should he lose in November. \nBut why would he start showing respect now? In regard to the latter, over the past several months we have heard numerous comments from Donald Trump about Latinos, Muslims, African Americans and women demonstrating his lack of respect, for which there has been no apology. \nHis final statement revisited every dog whistle racist trope he has uttered during this election. The breaking point, however, which should have come long before, came after we not only heard him personifying the rape culture norm of male entitlement to women's bodies, but the personal testimony of women who have experienced it at his hand, literally. \nThere are those who will not change their support for either candidate. But for the one in four women who have experienced sexual assault, or the many more who have experienced sexual harassment, as well as the family and friends of these survivors, the past two weeks have resurrected a lot of pain and anger that will be hard to move beyond. \nTrump's callous response has done very little to close what looks to be a historic gender gap. Very little of what he has said or done, tonight or any night, shows any evidence that \"no one respects women more than [he] does.\" \nWhile Latinos may still have legitimate questions about Hillary Clinton, tonight she continued to speak to the issues and values that so many of us hold; the importance of accessible education, equal pay and fare wages, the safety of our children and the opportunities for them to live to their potential, and the value of family. \nCeleste Montoya is an Associate Professor in the Department of Women & Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. Donald Trump is a Threat to Democracy Stephen A. Nu?o Stephen A. Nu?o \nPresident Lyndon Johnson once stood before the Statue of Liberty and declared, \"Our beautiful America was built by a nation of strangers. From a hundred different places or more, they have poured forth into an empty land, joining and blending in one mighty and irresistible tide.\" \nWhile I may dispute the emptiness of this land when Europeans migrated here, immigration is a foundational American value. In our declaration of independence from England, Jefferson outlined the reasons for taking up arms against the Crown, and among them was that the King had \"endeavored to prevent the population of these States\", meaning our Founders saw immigration as an important component of the perpetuation of our nation. \nOur beauty as a country not only rests on our faith in the democratic process but also in the struggle to move towards a nation which pursues the values stated in the founding of our government; to form a more perfect union of these states, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. \nIt is important to re-emphasize in this final debate and go away with a clear national understanding that Donald Trump is an absolute incomprehensible disaster. It's not only about policy but about his lack of respect for the fundamental dignity of our democracy, established by our founders. \nIt is beyond our collective memory for a presidential candidate to threaten to hold our electoral process hostage but also to have a repeated history of challenging the legitimacy of those he opposes. \nNot only was Trump a primary advocate of the birther movement, but he has now challenged the legitimacy of Clinton's candidacy by saying, \"She should not be allowed to run\" for the presidency. \nA final straw for any woman watching - as if there was one required at this point - was to hear a presidential candidate at one point say, \"No one has more respect for women than I do,\" and then turn around to our first woman presidential candidate and call her a \"nasty woman\" in a formal debate. \nStephen Nu\u00f1o is an Associate Professor in the Department of Politics and International Affairs at Northern Arizona University and an NBC Latino Contributor. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Nu\u00f1o advertisement \nFormer Governor of Arizona Jan Brewer recently raised the ire of Latinos by quickly dismissing that they could propel Hillary Clinton to victory in the state. \"Nah,\" she said, \"They don't get out and vote. They don't vote.\" She's right, but up to a point \u2014 2016 might prove to be quite a different year in Arizona, and Latinos are part of it. \nUnsurprisingly, political scientists see voter participation in more complicated terms than the former governor. The SB1070 bill, which codified racial profiling against Latinos, was a wake up call to the minority community, but without any substantial infrastructure in place to recruit Latinos, it's been a difficult path to realizing the power of the Latino vote. Bernie Sanders Rally, Flagstaff, Arizona Stephen A. Nu\u00f1o \nBut the Clinton campaign has long licked its lips over the potential presented by a young voting bloc that makes up over 30 percent of the population and will make up over 20 percent of the voters come this November. \nWith a perceptibly tight race for Senate that has left Sen. John McCain's image tattered with his refusal to denounce Donald Trump \u2014 combined with a strong moderate Democrat in Ann Kirkpatrick challenging him \u2014 Clinton seems to view the state ripe for the picking. \nLast week, the Clinton campaign sent crowd favorites to Arizona in Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and First Lady Michelle Obama, with a Chelsea Clinton rally sandwiched between the two megastars. One could also not ignore the persistent rumors at the rallies that Hillary Clinton will soon make an appearance in the Grand Canyon state as well. \nArizona is a stalwart Republican state, but it has always been made up of a testy electorate. The last time a Democrat won the Presidential vote in Arizona was in 1996 with Bill Clinton, but that required a tumultuous campaign and a third party candidate in Ross Perot who siphoned off about 8 percent of the voters. Clinton won the state with less than half the vote in Arizona, and not since Harry Truman in 1948 has a Democrat surpassed that mark with almost 54 percent. Clinton had lost the 1992 election to George H.W. Bush, with Perot slamming Arizona's two-party system with over 23 percent of the vote. \nSimilarly, Bernie Sanders was able to make waves in Arizona during the primary battle against Hillary Clinton earlier this year. Anchored by two bluish cities in Flagstaff in the north and Tucson in the south, Sanders garnered over 40 percent of the Democratic vote. At a rally in the picturesque mountain town of Flagstaff, Sanders stumped for Clinton and reeled in an overflowing crowd fueled by the university's substantial student population, which makes up about 25 thousand students in a city of about 65 thousand residents. Students overflow outside the Bernie Sanders rally for Hillary Clinton at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona Stephen A. Nu\u00f1o \nA young Latina millennial who supported Sanders in the primary and preferred not to be named came to see Sanders at the rally; she said she was supporting Clinton in the election. \"This election has divided us, but we need to unite,\" she said. \nThroughout the state, the Clinton campaign is feeling out pressure points in the Arizona vote and has reportedly added 2 million dollars to their efforts. Michelle Obama has been a popular draw in Phoenix and hundreds were left standing outside of the convention center because the venue was overflowing. The diverse crowd responded to the First Lady with roaring applause as she asserted one policy after another that was aimed at the young, minorities, and women. \n\"Look at us, just look at us,\" she said pointing to the diverse crowd. From Muslims and undocumented immigrants to veterans and even Republicans, Michelle Obama made an appeal to the common decency and made a contrast with Trump's rhetoric \u2014 calling Mexicans rapists, mocking a disabled reporter or his now infamous comments admitting to sexually assaulting women. \nDemocrats have stressed these incidents as Trump's voter base continues to shrink. In Arizona, this also exposes the soft underbelly of a Republican strategy that has long depended on stressing divisions in its appeal to a dwindling white male electorate. \nBut the strength of white voters in Arizona has also long been bolstered by a system designed to minimize their impact on Election Day. Latinos are faced with a plethora of systemic barriers that contribute to historically low turnout rates. As one of the first states to implement voter identification laws, Arizona has long been seen as an innovator in voter suppression. Arizona's Long History with Latino Voters \nIt was in Arizona that former Chief Justice William Rehnquist was accused of actively working to challenge minority voters during the 1960's. Operation Eagle Eye , a Republican program designed to fan out poll watchers for the purposes of intimidating black and Hispanic voters on Election Day. \n\"Caging\" was another popular tactic employed by Republicans, where letters would be sent out to predominantly black neighborhoods and any discrepancies or undelivered mail would be used to place voters on a list that would be used to challenge their eligibility to vote, purging them from the rolls. \nLatinos are also disproportionately young and poor compared to their white counterparts, making them more difficult to reach by the system. Language barriers have also created problems in the past. Counties in Arizona consistently print the wrong information on Spanish-language ballots, and candidates have tried all sorts of tricks to confuse Latino voters. \nFor instance, Russell Pearce, a powerful state senator who came under attack by moderate Republicans for his role in crafting the anti-immigrant bill SB1070, was infamously accused of putting a \" sham\" candidate named Olivia Cortes on the ballot in the hopes that her name would split the Latino vote. \nThe tricks employed against Hispanics are legend. One Republican candidate, Scott Michael Fistler, not only changed his party affiliation to Democrat, but legally changed his name to Cesar Chavez , the revered civil rights activist. Fistler's website contained stock photos of crowds holding \"Chavez\" signs, which turned out to be rallies for Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan President. \nThe response to Brewer's recent statement that Latinos don't vote was swift; local media and organizations moved to capitalize on Brewer's provocation. With two weeks to go before the election and with ballots already being cast in Arizona, Brewer's comments are the juicy bulletin board material opposing coaches look for to motivate their teams just before the big game. \nLaurie Roberts, a columnist for the largest paper in Arizona, wonders if the \"sleeping giant\" long talked about may be snoring no longer . However, if Brewer's statement woke anyone up, they'd be out of luck if they haven't registered; the deadline for this presidential election passed almost two weeks ago, October 10th. Latinos for Hillary cheers on Michelle Obama in Phoenix, AZ Stephen A. Nu\u00f1o \nVoting has already begun in Arizona and will continue until November 8th. Early estimates show a promising outlook for the Democrats, and the latest polls out of Arizona have shown Clinton ahead of Trump. \nFor Latinos who haven't done early voting, long lines await them in a final obstacle to having their vote counted. During the primary election this year, Maricopa County decided to reduce the number of polling stations from 200 in 2012 to 60. With the reduction in polling sites, there was further confusion over which site voters could go to. For instance, in 2012 there were designated sites for voters, but in 2014, voters could go to any of the 60 polling sites. \nSurvey data from Latino Decisions continues to paint a favorable picture for historic Latino turnout across the nation. Their latest tracking poll has continued to trend favorably for Clinton. As if the GOP could not be less popular, since the tracking poll started, favorability of Republicans in Congress fell from 30 percent to just 21 percent in just the last six weeks.

Nu\u00f1o \nWith a record 3.4 million Arizonans registered to vote , popularity will be a huge factor when the votes get counted on November 8th. Republicans still outnumber Democrats by about one hundred sixty-six thousand voters, but independent voters are barking up the heels of the GOP, with just under 21 thousand voters less. \nBoth the GOP and Independent voters make up about 34 percent of Arizonans each, and if the polls are correct, Trump's implosion may take others with him. \nThe election seems to be pointing to the inevitable demise of notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But it could also bring down Senator Jeff Flake, one of the most vocal Republicans to denounce Donald Trump for his rhetoric. \nOne of the most symbolic moments representing the problems facing Republicans into the future was when Barry Goldwater's granddaughter stood before the crowded auditorium waiting for Michelle Obama last week and said, \"This time, I'm with her.\" \nIn what must have felt like a tight cramp in the chest of Republican boomers, Carolyn Goldwater-Ross said, \"There is only one candidate that lives up to my grandfather's values.\" \nBarry Goldwater's pPresidential run in 1964 brings a mixed bag of emotions for Republicans. On the one hand the free market giant in the minds of Republicans marked a new beginning for the Party, and ushered in a newfound hope by the GOP to transform the nation into what ultimately became the Reagan presidency. Play ", "advertisement \nFor Jay Ly, every workday is different. \nSometimes, he gets up at 6 a.m. to meet with contractors at the two currently under construction locations of a Cajun restaurant that he co-founded with friends called Stinkin Crawfish. Other times, he's at the restaurant's three existing branches, fixing the occasional clogged drain or broken power outlet. \nHe's also busy coordinating with a friend and business partner about the two new locations, which are slated to be up and running by early 2017, perhaps even sooner. \nIt's a major change of pace from how Ly used to spend his days several years ago, when he was an inmate at four different correctional facilities, including San Quentin State Prison. \n\"The last 20 years of my life have been a whirlwind of events,\" he told NBC News. \"Most times, I'm grateful, and I just enjoy the fresh air, the ability to walk down the street, buy what I want and eat what I want to eat.\" A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews) \nFrom Vietnam to East Los Angeles \nBorn in Vietnam, Ly spent his childhood between Saigon and Nha Trang, a coastal city in the southern region of the country, he said. No adult figures were present during his early years: His mom was absent in his life, and he didn't meet his father until he was 5 years old, he said. He lived with his grandmother and uncle for a few years, but was essentially on his own. \n\"I had a dog. I just woke up every day and me and my dog would just go around and meet my friends,\" Ly said. \"I literally had a pair of shorts and ran around barefoot my whole childhood till they made me go to school.\" \nLy was about 9 years old when he journeyed to the United States. He said it was an abrupt move involving a pitch-black bus ride and swimming to a boat where he and his dad spent four to five days before arriving on an island. \"The last 20 years of my life have been a whirlwind of events. Most times, I'm grateful, and I just enjoy the fresh air, the ability to walk down the street, buy what I want and eat what I want to eat.\" \n\"I didn't know I was leaving,\" Ly said. \"I didn't even know where I was going.\" \nLy and his father wound up spending several months at two refugee camps, including one in the Philippines, before coming to the country in 1989 and settling in East Los Angeles. \nOnce he and his father arrived, it wasn't long before he was exposed to gangs, Ly said. In the fifth grade, his friends told him to bring a knife before going out to play basketball so that they wouldn't get jumped. \n\"So I came with a kitchen knife and sure enough, about a half hour or an hour later [after we started playing], about 10 to 12 Mexicans climbed the fence and started walking toward us,\" he said. \"We grabbed our knives, chased them, and they ran the opposite way.\" \nHis affiliation with gangs continued into his middle and high school years. Ly said being part of one at that time was more about bragging rights than anything else. Oftentimes, gang activities consisted of tagging whatever they could, including desks and folders, he said. Though Jay Ly's early life was tumultuous, his determination has allowed him to speak about his experiences at conferences and has led to the opening of multiple locations of Stinkin Crawfish. Deney Tuazon / Courtesy of Asian Americans Advancing Justice -- Los Angeles \nLy also began using and selling drugs, including crack cocaine and methamphetamine. He said he discovered he didn't like them much. And after witnessing the visible effects of drugs on his body, he decided to stop using them. \nIn his later teenage years, Ly felt the urge to escape the life he was living, but felt stuck and didn't know how to break away from his situation. \n\"I just did whatever my friends wanted. I didn't really have a voice,\" he said. \nIt was that attitude that would land Ly in prison. \nOne night 20 years ago, a person in a car that was involved in a road rage incident with a car Ly was driving was shot dead, according to Ly. In 1997, Ly went to trial facing 25 years to life on counts of first- and second-degree murder, according to court records acquired by NBC News. \nLy and a friend went to trial separately, and Ly was offered a plea bargain to testify against his friend, he said. He opted to decline the offer because he wanted to do the right thing and take responsibility for his actions, he said. \nAlthough he rejected the deal, he was given what he calls a \"second chance.\" Ly was found not guilty of the charges, and was instead convicted of a lesser count of manslaughter, according to court records. As a result, he received a reduced prison sentence of 12 years, of which he served 85 percent. \nA Second Chance \nSince that turning point in his life, Ly went on to attend San Francisco State University where he took on a course load of 15 to 18 units per semester and worked two to three jobs, he said. He graduated in 2009 with a degree in business administration with a concentration in computer information systems. Post by NBC News . \nAfter leaving prison, Ly worked at the Community Youth Center of San Francisco, a non-profit organization, from 2009 to 2013. There, he worked with Eddy Zheng, a formerly incarcerated Chinese American who served 21 years in prison for a crime he committed at the age of 16. \nWhile he was in the Bay Area, Ly also established called Bayview Youth Advocates (BYA), a multicultural group of high school students dedicated to making a positive impact on its community. BYA further conducts outreach to monolingual Chinese youth and families to offer public service assistance in multiple areas including housing applications and public safety awareness. \nToday, Ly is largely focused on the expansion of Stinkin Crawfish. He's also meeting with potential investors about a new restaurant chain he'd like to open. \nLy credits a large part of the reason he is where he is today, despite his prior conviction, to an elderly female juror who, along with two other Asian jurors, helped persuade the others to vote him guilty of manslaughter instead of murder. The lady kept in touch with Ly while he was in prison and even attended his graduation ceremony when he obtained his associate's degree while he was at San Quentin. Jay Ly speaking at a panel on incarceration at the 2016 Advancing Justice Conference in Los Angeles, California. Deney Tuazon / Courtesy of Asian Americans Advancing Justice -- Los Angeles \nOther contributors to his achievements, Ly said, are the volunteers who dedicated their time to work with prisoners in San Quentin and the attorney who fought for him during his trial. \n\"Those things are meaningful and not recognized,\" he said. \nAs an Asian American ex-convict, Ly said that a number of aspects need to be changed to prevent new immigrants to the United States from landing in prison like he did. Among these including immigration reform, providing resources for new immigrants, reforming the school system, and reconsidering felony disenfranchisement, as most states do not allow inmates to vote. \n\"Taking away someone's right to vote is not a punishment. It's a punishment against the other people who are voting,\" he said. \"If you take away my vote, I cannot vote to help you when the time comes.\" \n\"We don't need to make a decision,\" he added. \"We just need a voice. That's all we're asking for.\" \"Taking away someone's right to vote is not a punishment. It's a punishment against the other people who are voting. If you take away my vote, I cannot vote to help you when the time comes.\" \nLy added that understanding each other is crucial if people wish to see more tales of success from formerly incarcerated individuals like himself. \n\"In order for all of this to happen, we all need to understand the pain and suffering that everyone has, and do something to help each other to end the cycle of violence among all people,\" he said. \"When we do that, it makes us human and makes the world a better place.\" \nFor him, it was the understanding of the female juror who made his second chance possible,. \n\"When I got out, I always visited her and [took] her to lunch when I [came] to L.A.,\" he said. \"I haven't talked to her the last two years with the restaurants, but I've been planning to take her here to show it off to her.\" \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr .

Among their hopes were to mobilize the young Latino population. \nRELATED: Can Latino Vote Help End GOP Reign in Arizona? \n\"We will not elect a president who objectifies women, who boasts about sexual assault\u2026and this is a candidate who says to our Mexican brothers and sisters, you are rapists and you are criminals,\" Sanders said to an enthusiastic crowd in Flagstaff, Arizona.

The report finds that 70 percent of Latinos in Texas have yet to be contacted with just two weeks to go before Election Day. \nTexas doesn't track voters' ethnicity, but the Texas Secretary of State has reported an increase in Spanish-surname voters, according to Texas Monthly. Spanish surname is not a certain indication of Latino voters as some Latinos have names that would not fit the category, such as George P. Bush and others have married Hispanics and taken their spouse's Spanish surname. Also, Hispanics in Texas vote Republican in higher rates than in many other states. \nArturo Vargas, executive director of NALEO said, \"It is time that the political and funding communities finally put their money where their mouths are by making the investments necessary now to engage Latinos for 2020, 2024 and beyond if we want the nation's second largest population group to realize its true political potential once and for all.\" \nOther key finds from the poll: Top issues for Latino voters varies state-by-state. While immigration ranked first for Latino voters in three states (California, Nevada and North Carolina), Latino voters in the remaining four states viewed other issues as more important. In Arizona and New York, improving wages and incomes was the top issue, while Florida Latino voters were most concerned about combatting terrorism and ISIS. For Texan Latino voters, lowering the cost of health care was the most important issue this election. Latino voters are supporting the Senate bids of U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez and former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto. Cortez Masto, a Democrat, has the support of Latino voters (54 percent) in her battle against Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Heck (24 percent) for the seat being vacated by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat. In the two-way race for the Senate seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, also a Democrat, Latino voters are supporting U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez (47 percent) over current California Attorney General Kamala Harris (30 percent). Both are Democrats.

Bernie Sanders tirelessly tried to make hay out of the fact that the former Secretary of State would not release transcripts of paid speeches she had delivered to Wall Street audiences. Clinton repeatedly insisted she would release them if and when all the candidates running from both parties made the same disclosures. \nBut now that the primaries are over and Clinton and Trump are last major candidates standing, her position would not seem to hold up to review . Of course, WikiLeaks may have done the job for her: Earlier this month they released what were purported to be excerpts from those speeches. \nProof of Melania Trump's citizenship status \u2014 As the Slovenia-born Melania Trump began to draw more scrutiny as a potential first lady, questions started to be raised about how she obtained her citizenship status. \"She has got it so documented,\" Trump insisted back in August. He pledged to hold a press conference that would provide detailed information to quell rumors about her background.

Melania Trump did eventually share a letter on social media from her attorney claiming that she never worked in the U.S. in 1995, which would have been prior to her officially obtaining a work visa. But skeptics still believe the matter is yet to be settled because no definitive proof was attached to the denials. \nEvidence to refute Donald Trump's accusers \u2014 After a group of women (now 12 ) recently came forward to accuse Trump of past sexual assaults, the candidate and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, promised to release evidence that would discredit all of them. Initially, Trump said this evidence would come out in the \"appropriate way and at the appropriate time.\" But later, Pence went even further, promising detailed rebuttals \"before the day is out\" \u2014 that was on Oct. 14. \"Before the day is out, there will be evidence that calls into question these [sexual assault] allegations\" - Pence https://t.co/qWfYTaATS6 pic.twitter.com/pnat6m8rF0 \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) October 14, 2016 \nBut with the exception of one alleged witness (whose reliability has been seriously questioned) to an incident that was supposed to have taken place on an airplane more that 35 years ago, the Trump campaign has not produced anything to prove his accusers demonstrably false. \nAlthough Trump has said that all of the allegations have been \"debunked,\" the reality is that it will very much be his word against his accusers' for the foreseeable future. \nRepublican plan to expand the electoral map \u2014 The Trump campaign prides itself on keeping many of its major policy proposals close to the chest. They have a \"secret\" plan to defeat ISIS. They have a \"beautiful\" replacement for Obamacare. But one of the most curious assertions yet to be supported by concrete data is Trump's insistence during the GOP primaries that he could put dark blue states like New York, California, New Jersey and Connecticut in play . \nWhile Trump did dominate Republican primary contests in most of the traditionally Democratic-leaning states, and his unconventional background and politics might make him uniquely appealing to previously untapped constituencies for the GOP, he has consistently performed like a traditional red state candidate in places like New York and California. \nEven his campaign's own battleground map concedes that the biggest blue strongholds from the last two and half decades are off the table.

And the Latino political voice will only grow with a larger share of millennial Latinos than the national average as well as a greater share of citizens by birth. Together these factors put Arizona Latinos on a path to increased political participation. \nBut demography is not destiny. Change to the Arizona political landscape by Latinos will require action, namely voting. In 2012, the turnout among Latino registered voters was about 17 percent, but about 48 percent did not register, according to the Willie C. Velasquez Institute. advertisement \nThis is where the state's harsh anti-immigrant tone and laws come into play. In 2010, SB 1070 was signed into law (although a couple of its provisions were overturned by the Supreme Court). Arizona became the poster child of extreme anti-immigrant laws. \nRELATED: Clinton Beats Trump Among Latinos 76 Percent to 14 Percent \nArizona is also home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio who, after Trump, is the best-known opponent of comprehensive immigration reform. It's no coincidence that Donald Trump chose Arizona to deliver his speech where he doubled down on his enforcement only approach to immigration.

In 1994 California experienced a similar (though shorter lived) anti-immigrant movement culminating in Proposition 187 . The ballot initiative that excluded all undocumented persons from any state services (e.g. school or emergency rooms) passed, but was ultimately blocked by the courts. advertisement \nCalifornia's Prop 187 didn't have the intended consequence of restricting basic government services from undocumented immigrants. Quite the contrary, it ended up mobilizing the state's Latino community - Latinos began to turn out, register and naturalize in numbers beyond those predicted by population growth alone. \nRELATED: Opinion: Will Trump Be 2016's Prop 187 For Latino Voters? \nPerhaps the bigger impact of Prop 187 is that it definitively distanced Latinos from the Republican Party that had supported the proposition. In 1992, 38 percent of California Latinos identified with the Democratic Party. Less than a decade later, that figure rose to 63 percent. Up until 1994, California was a swing state, but after the Latino awakening from Prop 187, California moved squarely into the blue state column. In the course of four years, Latinos went from supporting Obama at a rate of 58 percent to 77 percent. \nTo be sure, Arizona is not California. And as a native Arizonan, I know. However, there is one important similarity - harsh GOP sponsored anti-immigrant measures in the context of a growing Latino electorate. The pattern of rapid Latino growth that California experienced in the 1990s is mirrored in the Grand Canyon state. advertisement Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton looks on before she speaks at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Union Hall on August 4, 2016 in Las Vegas. According to recent polls, Clinton leads her opponent Republican Donald Trump in several swing states including New Hampshire and Florida. David Becker / Getty Images \nEvidence from the 2012 presidential election indicates that like in California, Latinos in Arizona were mobilized in response to Republican sponsored anti-immigrant legislation. \nIn 2008, the share of Latinos that voted for then-Sen. Barack Obama in Arizona was 14 percent less than the national average for Latinos. Arizona has been more conservative across the board - for Latinos and non-Latinos alike. \nHowever, in the election after S.B. 1070, Arizona Latinos voted for Obama above the national Latino average. In the course of four years, Latinos went from supporting Obama at a rate of 58 percent to 77 percent. \nRELATED: Opinion: From Arizona's Immigration Legacy to Trump \nA group of political scientists ran the numbers to estimate what this Latino partisan shift and population growth in Arizona translates into. After some sophisticated number crunching, they found that in 2016 Democrats have a 53 percent chance of putting Arizona in the blue column. \nThere are a number of caveats in this statistical model, such as white non-Latino voting not surging and Latino turnout not dipping. Nevertheless, Arizona is in play. Even if Republicans carry Arizona it will be by the skin of their teeth and it will be one of the last times it happens. The Latino mobilization that Arizona's S.B. 1070 put into place is irreversible and together with population growth is a permanent political game changer. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

Nu\u00f1o advertisement \nIn a presidential election wrapped with the harsh immigration rhetoric of Donald Trump, a new poll shows that the GOP nominee is a drag on other Republican races in swing states, but that Democrats are not making the most of it because they are leaving Latino votes on the table. \nThe poll of Latino voters in six battleground states, commissioned by immigration advocacy group America's Voice and conducted by L atino Decisions polling firm, showed Trump viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of Latinos in every state but Florida, where it is 65 percent. \nLatino Decisions polled Latinos in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and Virginia.

But many Latino voters were unaware of where either candidate stood on immigration or Trump. \nAdvocates called this a missed opportunity because enthusiasm and interest was reported to be high largely because of the attention brought on by the media on Trump. Also, immigration was named as the top issue or one of the top issues important to Latinos and that the president and Congress should address. \nFor example, when Latino voters in Arizona were asked if they knew where the Democratic candidate, Ann Kirkpatrick, stood on immigration issues, 76 percent said they did not know. \nIn North Carolina, 71 percent did not know the immigration view of Republican Sen. Richard Burr and 76 percent did not know that of his Democratic challenger Deborah Ross. \nBurr voted against the 2013 comprehensive immigration bill and has voted to end President Barack Obama's executive action programs that would shield millions of immigrants from deportation and allow them to work. Ross is supportive of of comprehensive immigration reform and Obama's programs. advertisement \nWhen asked if they would be more or less likely to support their Republican Senate candidate if they knew the candidate was supporting Trump, Latino voters had a more negative view of that candidate. \nSixty-eight percent of Latinos surveyed said they would be less likely to vote for Burr if they knew he was supporting Trump, which he is. 1/3: I always said I would support the nominee and it's clear @realDonaldTrump has won the #Republican Presidential Primary. \u2014 Richard Burr (@Burrforsenate) May 4, 2016 \n\"The numbers on the Senate race are very concerning and show that Latinos are not aware of Ross' pro-immigrant stance or that their two-term sitting senator, Burr, is anti-immigrant,\" said Tim Eakins, state director of North Carolina's Voice, an affiliate of America's Voice. \nRELATED: New Poll Shows Trump's Problems With Latinos Won't Get Better \nIn no battleground state surveyed did more than half of the Latino registered voters say that they were contacted by a political party, community organization, or campaign. Nationally, 60 percent of Latinos said they were not contacted in the past few months, according to a separate Latino Decisions poll. \nGiven the response, \"the big story of the day is that Democrats are not investing in outreach to Latinos. With only 60 days left, Ross has a clear opportunity to make big gains with Latinos,\" Eakins said. ", "Sep 21 2016, 3:42 pm ET Latino Democratic Rep.

Trump thinks that Syrian refugees arriving in the U.S have it too easy, and that undocumented immigrants are treated better than veterans. He believes that we should institute an \"ideological loyalty test\" for prospective immigrants; never mind that this would likely be unconstitutional. He described some immigrants as a potential \"Trojan Horse,\" and reeled off crimes allegedly committed by undocumented people. advertisement \nWhat Trump did not do was deliver a speech grounded in fact. He ignored the reality that, according to experts and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, our border is more secure and safer than ever. He ignored the reality that illegal immigration is down , with more Mexicans leaving than entering the U.S. He ignored the reality that undocumented immigrants are our friends, family members, colleagues, employees, and neighbors. Instead viewers got a fiery tirade invoking every negative stereotype of what Trump called \"criminal aliens\" and a long list of all the people he plans to deport on Day One. \nTrump stated that the only way that undocumented people might be allowed to adjust their status is if they return to their countries of origin, apply to re-enter legally, and go through a vetting process. But under current immigration law, this is not possible. Anyone who has remained in the U.S. illegally for over six months who leaves the country - for any reason - is automatically subject to a ban on re-entry for three years, ten years , or sometimes permanently. These provisions apply even if someone is leaving to apply for a visa or entry permit at a consulate. \nMeanwhile, consider that 62 percent of the undocumented have lived here for more than a decade, and one-fifth have lived here for more than two decades. Imagine the social and economic disruption if such people were forced back to countries where they no longer belong. So Trump's notion that he will make people leave and then allow the \"good ones\" to come back is as impractical as it is inhumane. \nAs Trump enumerated his ideas, from ending funding for sanctuary cities to increasing the budget for the Border Patrol, he mostly overlooked the fact that such proposals must all go through Congress. That's one reason we do not yet have national mandatory E-Verify or an entry/exit tracking system for visas; lawmakers may like these ideas in theory, but they balk at funding them. Does Trump plan on making Congress pay for programs the same way he intends to make Mexico pay for the wall? Trump's immigration screed veered into blatant falsehoods. advertisement \nAt times, Trump's screed veered into blatant falsehoods. He claimed that undocumented immigrants are a net drain on society, while there is solid research showing otherwise . He ripped into the \"Obama/Clinton\" immigration failures, even though Hillary Clinton, in her former role as Secretary of State, did not set immigration policy. He said that Clinton wants \"open borders for all\" which is not true. For the record , Clinton plans to work with Congress on an overhaul of our immigration system, end immigrant family detention, and use executive action only as a last resort. \nFor undocumented immigrants and their allies, much of Trump's speech was chilling. He vowed to cancel DACA, which has helped thousands of young people live productive lives without fear of deportation. He wants to bring back the troublesome 287(g) and Secure Communities programs, which sowed fear in immigrant communities until President Obama's DHS phased them out . And just in case there were any doubt about what a Trump administration would be like, The Donald was clear: \"Everyone not following immigration laws is subject to deportation.\" He went so far as to suggest that anyone apprehended for immigration violations be detained and deported at once, without the due process required by law. Such disregard for our justice system and civil liberties is staggering. \nHow darkly ironic that this virulent anti-immigrant sentiment comes from a man who has been accused of using illegal workers on his hotels and properties , whose modeling agency allegedly flouted immigration law , who prefers to hire cheaper foreign labor over Americans at his Florida resort , and whose wife has her own immigration controversy . Hostility, meet hypocrisy. \nBasically, Trump's \"new\" immigration policy is what is has been all along, the mobilizing of xenophobia towards immigrants and anyone else his base views as The Other. The only positive takeaway from Trump's proposals was that they exist in a far-right bubble, away from the large majorities of Americans who favor practical immigration solutions. According to a July Gallup poll , 84 percent of Americans, including 76 percent of Republicans, want a path to citizenship for the undocumented with conditions - something Trump derides as \"amnesty.\" Two-thirds of Americans, incidentally, are against Trump's wall. \nTrump's immigration speech should serve notice on anyone who still believes that he can or is willing to change for the general election. The GOP nominee for president intends to make America Great Again by terrorizing and demonizing immigrants, and by trampling on our nation's core values in the process. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

( AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) Charlie Neibergall / AP \n* Share \n* Share \n* Tweet \n* Share \n* Comment \nFor Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, it's about much more than making that next main debate stage -- or being the second-choice candidate in the polls. \n\"I know this, in your heart of hearts, everybody here cannot wait to see me debate Hillary Clinton,\" Fiorina told 500 Republicans, slightly grinning, at Sen. Chuck Grassley's Jimmy Buffett-esque summer picnic in northern Iowa last Thursday. \n\"And you know, there's only one way that happens\" -- by winning the GOP presidential nomination, she added. \nOn the campaign trail, Fiorina is making her pitch as the businesswoman. The citizen. The woman of faith. The toughest candidate on the world stage. The reasonable outsider listening to Iowa's farmers. \nThe former Hewlett-Packard CEO logged 11 hours -- and even hit one deer -- in her car over a four-day, eight-stop stint that ended on Saturday through the northwestern corner of Iowa, a region filled with evangelical voters and an economy fueled by agriculture. \n\"When I walked into that [second-stage] debate, less than 40 percent of Republican primary voters had ever heard my name,\" Fiorina told NBC News this weekend. \"So they didn't know who I was. They didn't even know I was running.\" \nAnd with the next GOP debate coming up in two weeks -- the main stage is limited to the top 10 GOP candidates in national polls -- Fiorina is trying to introduce herself to more Republicans. \n\"I don't know her history. I just know today I was very impressed,\" Susan Henrich, 68, of Remsen, Iowa, said of Fiorina after a town hall event at the Blue Bell Ice Cream Factory in Le Mars. \nDan Schermerhorn, 69, a retired mail carrier from Scranton, Iowa, was more emphatic: \"She knows where she's going. She has the experience. She's not saying this is wrong, this is wrong, but she says this is what I'm going to do to change it.\" \nA Monmouth poll released on Monday had her in third place in Iowa at 10 percent. \nIn a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll released on Saturday, just five percent of Iowans named Fiorina as their top choice. But 11 percent said Fiorina would be their second choice. \n\"We're right where we ought to be. Honestly, I would be worried if we had suddenly skyrocketed to the top after that first debate because that's not necessarily a sustainable trajectory,\" Christopher Rants, Fiorina's Iowa state chairman, said after the release of the latest poll. \n\"Last cycle, you saw every candidate sort of had their flavor of the month and then went away. I like the trajectory that we're on -- continue to introduce ourselves. We want people who want more from us.\" \nThe CEO Liability? \nFiorina's business record -- 30,000 employees of Hewlett-Packard lost their jobs during her tenure as CEO -- is considered a potential major liability to her campaign, yet on this Iowa swing, her time at HP registered nearly no concern among voters. \n\"Politics plays out in the board room -- the same way as it plays out other places, and she got involved in a fight,\" Dale Guge, 68, of Okoboji said. \nHis friend, Chuck Andreasen, 70, cut Guge off: \"I ran a company for 28 years, and somebody has to make decisions. And she was brought into the company to make those decisions. And if you're going to say, I'm sorry I had to do that, you'd be foolish. But she did what she had to do to save that company.\" \nGuge added: \"The other part of Carly at HP, they act like she ruined the company. But you have to remember that all was occurring at the same time as the bubble.\" \nThe Immigration Pitch \nFiorina, in an interview with NBC News over the weekend, criticized Donald Trump for the most polarizing proposals of his immigration plan. \n\"I've been very clear I don't support deportation. I don't support amending the Constitution or challenging the 14th Amendment,\" Fiorina said. \n\"I think these are ideas that stoke anger but don't solve problems . I think Donald Trump is stoking anger without solving problems . And I think others, now, are sadly pandering to him.\" \nIt's a pivot from the last two weeks ago, when Fiorina refused to criticize Trump's impact on the debate over immigration beyond her stated opposition to ending birthright citizenship. \nFiorina's stump speeches include demands for the federal government to secure the border and establish an effective employer-verification system. \nBut absent from the events are specific calls to undo President Obama's executive actions. \nFollowing her town hall at Iowa State University in Ames, Fiorina said she would be open to passing a version of the Dream Act to grant citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children . \n\"Perhaps their children can earn citizenship because I don't think we should punish children for the sins of their fathers and mothers. I don't.\" \nThe Agriculture Pitch \nFiorina made her final stop on Saturday morning in Des Moines at the Iowa Corn Growers Association's policy conference -- telling the nearly 250 corn growers that she supported allowing the Renewable Fuel Standard to expire in 2022, as current law states, if subsidies for fossil fuels also end. \n(The Renewable Fuel Standard requires a certain amount a biofuel be blended into U.S. fuel supplies, guaranteeing ethanol access into the gas market -- which seen as a big boon to Iowa farmers.) \n\"Government shouldn't be giving certain fuels tax credits, access to markets that is beneficial to one industry over another,\" Fiorina, the only candidate to accept the association's invitation to attend, told the growers. \n\"Government shouldn't be setting prices. Government shouldn't be picking winners and losers .\" \nAfter that line, the room -- for perhaps the only time on her entire trip -- failed to applaud when the candidate finished her specific thought. But her position is not necessarily an unpopular one with the growers. \n\"If she believes that [the RFS] should go away after 2022, that's fine, but I'd like to see oil put on a level playing field and take away the subsidies, and we'd be more than willing to play that game,\" stated Bob Hemesath, president of the association and a corn grower in Decora. \nThe Religious Pitch \nThe last two Republican winners of the Iowa caucuses won with significant portions of the state's large evangelical population. \nSen. Ted Cruz, who hosted a \"Religious Liberty Rally\" in Des Moines one week ago, and Ben Carson, who is targeting members of church congregations across the state, are each making strong ploys for the evangelical vote. \nBut Fiorina is, too. At each of her events, she speaks forwardly about her faith, repeating the phrase \"God-given gifts\" several times over the course of an event. \nIn Le Mars, after referencing her bout with cancer and loss of her daughter to drug addiction , Fiorina told the crowd: \"Through the good times and the bad times, I have been sustained by my personal relationship with Jesus Christ.\" \nThe Businesswoman Pitch \n\"Sometimes people ask me how I went from secretary to CEO. Truth is, I didn't have a plan,\" Fiorina hashes out to the crowds on the road. \nAnd she reminds everyone that her husband, Frank, \"started out as a tow-truck driver in a family-owned auto body shop.\" \nOn taxes, Fiorina told a crowd in Carroll: \"Lower every rate. Close every loophole.\" \nFiorina also noted to an Iowa State University gathering of about 200 people that she will sidestep taking on Social Security reforms until she \"can demonstrate to the American people that the federal government is competent at its job\" by addressing other issues like \"securing the border.\" \nAlso in Carroll, the former CEO blasted Dodd-Frank -- the 2010 law that set up tighter regulations on financial institutions -- calling it \"crony capitalism\" and responsible for creating \"even bigger, more powerful, more corrupt Wall Street banks\" and putting \"thousands of community banks\" out of business. \nAnd she warned those in attendance about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created under the law. \"Word to the wise, they're in there looking at all of our credit card receipts to see if they can detect signs of fraud. I'll tell you what: That worries me a whole lot more than the NSA, to be honest,\" Fiorina said. \nFiorina also embraces and emphasizes her own foreign-policy credentials. \n\"I know more world leaders on the stage than anyone running,\" Fiorina would recite at her stops--this one in Le Mars. \n\"Perhaps Hillary Clinton has met a few more than I have, but she did photo ops -- I had business, or charity, or policy discussions. I have sat this close to Vladimir Putin. To Angela Merkel. To David Cameron. To the Chinese premiership over three successive generations. King Abdullah of Jordan. The Saudi royal family. You name it -- I probably know them.\" \nVaughn Hillyard * Twitter \n* Email \nTopics 2016 Election \nFirst Published Aug 31 2015, 1:33 pm ET \nNext Story Analysis: Trump's Lengthy History of Conspiracy Theories and Rumors", "Sep 27 2016, 12:13 am ET Full Transcript from the First Presidential Debate Between Trump, Clinton by NBC News Political Unit Share Watch the Full First Presidential Debate 37:55 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/773634627997\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nThe full transcript from the first presidential debate Monday at Hofstra University involving Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Lester Holt, anchor of NBC Nightly News, served as moderator. \nHOLT: Good evening from Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News.\" I want to welcome you to the first presidential debate. \nThe participants tonight are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. The commission drafted tonight's format, and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. advertisement \nThe 90-minute debate is divided into six segments, each 15 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight: Achieving prosperity; America's direction; and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead-off question to both candidates, and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion. \nThe questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. \nI will invite you to applaud, however, at this moment, as we welcome the candidates: Democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. \n(APPLAUSE) advertisement \n(APPLAUSE) \nWell, I don't expect us to cover all the issues of this campaign tonight, but I remind everyone, there are two more presidential debates scheduled. We are going to focus on many of the issues that voters tell us are most important, and we're going to press for specifics. I am honored to have this role, but this evening belongs to the candidates and, just as important, to the American people. \nCandidates, we look forward to hearing you articulate your policies and your positions, as well as your visions and your values. So, let's begin. \nWe're calling this opening segment \"Achieving Prosperity.\" And central to that is jobs. There are two economic realities in America today. There's been a record six straight years of job growth, and new census numbers show incomes have increased at a record rate after years of stagnation. However, income inequality remains significant, and nearly half of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. \nBeginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works? advertisement \nCLINTON: Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. \nThe central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs, with rising incomes. \nI want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work. \nI also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top. \nAnd I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work. I've heard from so many of you about the difficult choices you face and the stresses that you're under. So let's have paid family leave, earned sick days. Let's be sure we have affordable child care and debt-free college. advertisement \nHow are we going to do it? We're going to do it by having the wealthy pay their fair share and close the corporate loopholes. \nFinally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better. I hope that I will be able to earn your vote on November 8th. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, thank you. \nMr. Trump, the same question to you. It's about putting money -- more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two minutes. \nTRUMP: Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They're devaluing their currency, and there's nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight. Because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China, and many other countries are doing the same thing. \nSo we're losing our good jobs, so many of them. When you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much. \nSo Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're all leaving. And we can't allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later. \nBut we have to stop our jobs from being stolen from us. We have to stop our companies from leaving the United States and, with it, firing all of their people. All you have to do is take a look at Carrier air conditioning in Indianapolis. They left -- fired 1,400 people. They're going to Mexico. So many hundreds and hundreds of companies are doing this. \nTRUMP: We cannot let it happen. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. It's going to be a beautiful thing to watch. \nCompanies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start. And I look very, very much forward to doing it. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond? \nCLINTON: Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And we need to have smart, fair trade deals. \nWe also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had. \nI call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. \nWe just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. \nI think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives. I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. \nI don't buy that. I have a different experience. My father was a small-businessman. He worked really hard. He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going. \nAnd so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we'll grow. That's the kind of economy I want us to see again. \nHOLT: Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if you can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back? \nTRUMP: Well, for one thing -- and before we start on that -- my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. \nOur country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China. They're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. \nSo we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals. And, Lester, they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that, frankly, we don't do. \nLet me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell in -- automatic, 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. It's been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven't done anything about it. \nNow, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton -- yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. \nBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact... \nHOLT: Let me interrupt just a moment, but... \nTRUMP: Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we've created a movement. They should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is -- look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer, Lester. HOLT: Back to the question, though. How do you bring back -- specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers? How do you make them bring the jobs back? \nTRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them. They're leaving, and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. \nAnd what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. \nAnd once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies. So what I'm saying is, we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving. And that's a big, big factor. \nHOLT: Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here. \nCLINTON: Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm. \nIn fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, \"Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money.\" Well, it did collapse. \nTRUMP: That's called business, by the way. \nCLINTON: Nine million people -- nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. \nNow, we have come back from that abyss. And it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. \nIndependent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed, and basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle-class families compared to the wealthy, were to go into effect, we would lose 3.5 million jobs and maybe have another recession. \nThey've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy. Take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean- energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real. \nTRUMP: I did not. I did not. I do not say that. \nCLINTON: I think science is real. \nTRUMP: I do not say that. \nCLINTON: And I think it's important that we grip this and deal with it, both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity. \nSo I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump? \nTRUMP: She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. \nNow, look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with $20 trillion in debt. \nThe Obama administration, from the time they've come in, is over 230 years' worth of debt, and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven-and-a-half years, to be semi- exact. \nSo I will tell you this. We have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs. And we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentives to build new companies or to expand, because they're not doing it. \nAnd all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio and look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving, they're gone. \nAnd, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions. \nCLINTON: Well, actually... \nTRUMP: I will bring -- excuse me. I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. \nCLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit. \nTRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years. \nCLINTON: And I have -- well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again... \nTRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA... \n(CROSSTALK) \nCLINTON: ... million new jobs, a balanced budget... \nTRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. \nTRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting -- no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. \nCLINTON: That's a -- that's -- go to the -- please, fact checkers, get to work. \nHOLT: OK, you are unpacking a lot here. And we're still on the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy. \nSecretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And, Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump. \nTRUMP: Well, I'm really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies. They're going to do a tremendous job. \nI'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax -- it's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for the middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand. \nAnd when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they're going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can't bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won't allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what -- is so bad. \nSo what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country. And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to -- and everybody agrees it should be brought back. \nInstead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together. Because we have -- we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something. \nAnd here's the thing. Republicans and Democrats agree that this should be done, $2.5 trillion. I happen to think it's double that. It's probably $5 trillion that we can't bring into our country, Lester. And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful. \nBut we have no leadership. And honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton. \nHOLT: All right. You have two minutes of the same question to defend tax increases on the wealthiest Americans, Secretary Clinton. \nCLINTON: I have a feeling that by, the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened. \nTRUMP: Why not? \nCLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not? \n(LAUGHTER) \nYou know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this, it is absolutely the case... \nTRUMP: There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into their country. \nHOLT: This is -- this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes, please. \nTRUMP: Yes. \nCLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start the clock again, Lester. We've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to support that. \nTRUMP: Then you didn't read it. \nCLINTON: I happen to -- I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit. But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed an approach that has a... \nTRUMP: Who gave it that name? The first I've -- who gave it that name? \n(CROSSTALK) \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this is Secretary Clinton's two minutes. \nCLINTON: ... $4 billion tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing... \nTRUMP: How much? How much for my family? CLINTON: ... it is... \nTRUMP: Lester, how much? \nCLINTON: ... as I said, trumped-up trickle-down. Trickle-down did not work. It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked. \nAnd a lot of really smart, wealthy people know that. And they are saying, hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class. \nCLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts. \nWhen I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me, and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America? And are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for. The biggest one, a multinational one known as CAFTA, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals. \nBut let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it, and I've said what I'm going to do. I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable. \nWhen I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs. \nHOLT: Very quickly... \nTRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... \nCLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald... \nTRUMP: You haven't done it. You haven't done it. \nCLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state... \nTRUMP: Excuse me. \nCLINTON: And I have done a lot... \nTRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. \nCLINTON: Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. \nTRUMP: You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. \nAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. \nCLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in... \nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard. \n(CROSSTALK) \nTRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. \nCLINTON: No. \nTRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. \nCLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are -- I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated... \nTRUMP: Not. \nCLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book... \nTRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault? \nCLINTON: ... before you even announced. \nTRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault? \nCLINTON: Look, there are differences... \nTRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? \nCLINTON: There are... \nTRUMP: Because he's pushing it. \nCLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going again. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add $5 trillion to the debt. \nTRUMP: But you have no plan. \nCLINTON: But in -- oh, but I do. \nTRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan. \nCLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called \"Stronger Together.\" You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore... \nTRUMP: That's about all you've... \n(CROSSTALK) \nHOLT: Folks, we're going to... \nCLINTON: ... or at an airport near you. \nHOLT: We're going to move to... \nCLINTON: But it's because I see this -- we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. \nSo we have a very robust set of plans. And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession. \nTRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. \nAnd by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. \nWhen I go around -- Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over. And when I go around, despite the tax cut, the thing -- the things that business as in people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations, and new companies cannot form and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulations and make them even worse. \nI'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story. \nHOLT: Let me get you to pause right there, because we're going to move into -- we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk taxes... \nCLINTON: That can't -- that can't be left to stand. \nHOLT: Please just take 30 seconds and then we're going to go on. \nCLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so... \nTRUMP: Facts. \nCLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. Because what I have proposed... \nTRUMP: And take a look at mine, also, and you'll see. \nCLINTON: ... would not add a penny to the debt, and your plans would add $5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country. \nHOLT: Well, you just opened the next segment. \nTRUMP: Well, could I just finish -- I think I... \n(CROSSTALK) \nHOLT: I'm going to give you a chance right here... \nTRUMP: I think I should -- you go to her website, and you take a look at her website. \nHOLT: ... with a new 15-minute segment... \nTRUMP: She's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to... \nTRUMP: And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. \nHOLT: The next segment, we're continuing... \nCLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS. \nHOLT: ... achieving prosperity... \nTRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. \nCLINTON: No, we're not. No, we're not. \nCLINTON: I don't think top-down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance their -- their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're... \nTRUMP: Typical politician. All talk, no action. Sounds good, doesn't work. Never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on. \nNow, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me: We're in a bubble right now. And the only thing that looks good is the stock market, but if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. \nWe are in a big, fat, ugly bubble. And we better be awfully careful. And we have a Fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political -- by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay, yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is so that voters will know if their potential president owes money to -- who he owes it to and any business conflicts. Don't Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest? \nTRUMP: I don't mind releasing -- I'm under a routine audit. And it'll be released. And -- as soon as the audit's finished, it will be released. \nBut you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections, where I filed a 104-page essentially financial statement of sorts, the forms that they have. It shows income -- in fact, the income -- I just looked today -- the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million. If you would have told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would have been very surprised. \nBut that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody -- Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means, who's negotiating these trade deals? \nWe have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals. \nHOLT: The IRS says an audit... \nTRUMP: Excuse me. \nHOLT: ... of your taxes -- you're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal... \nTRUMP: Well, I told you, I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, do you get audited? I get audited almost every year. \nAnd in a way, I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the IRS. But other people don't. \nI will say this. We have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns -- against my lawyer's wishes -- when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. \n(APPLAUSE) \nI will release my tax returns. And that's against -- my lawyers, they say, \"Don't do it.\" I will tell you this. No -- in fact, watching shows, they're reading the papers. Almost every lawyer says, you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it. But I would go against them if she releases her e-mails. \nHOLT: So it's negotiable? \nTRUMP: It's not negotiable, no. Let her release the e-mails. Why did she delete 33,000... \nHOLT: Well, I'll let her answer that. But let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement. We did ask you to be silent, so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I think you've seen another example of bait-and- switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think, 39, 40 years of our tax returns, but everyone has done it. We know the IRS has made clear there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. \nSo you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. \nCLINTON: Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax. \nTRUMP: That makes me smart. \nCLINTON: So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide. \nAnd the financial disclosure statements, they don't give you the tax rate. They don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see. And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding. \nAnd we'll guess. We'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that, and he should provide them. \nHOLT: He also -- he also raised the issue of your e-mails. Do you want to respond to that? \nCLINTON: I do. You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail. \nTRUMP: That's for sure. \nCLINTON: And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump? \nTRUMP: That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. OK? That was not a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it's -- really thinks it's disgraceful, also. \nAs far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you. You learn a lot from financial disclosure. And you should go down and take a look at that. \nThe other thing, I'm extremely underleveraged. The report that said $650 -- which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to what I had. \nThe buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was -- actually, it wasn't even a bad story, to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion. And the $650 isn't even on that. But it's not $650. It's much less than that. \nBut I could give you a list of banks, I would -- if that would help you, I would give you a list of banks. These are very fine institutions, very fine banks. I could do that very quickly. \nI am very underleveraged. I have a great company. I have a tremendous income. And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. \nWhen we have $20 trillion in debt, and our country's a mess, you know, it's one thing to have $20 trillion in debt and our roads are good and our bridges are good and everything's in great shape, our airports. Our airports are like from a third world country. \nYou land at LaGuardia, you land at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you land at Newark, and you come in from Dubai and Qatar and you see these incredible -- you come in from China, you see these incredible airports, and you land -- we've become a third world country. \nSo the worst of all things has happened. We owe $20 trillion, and we're a mess. We haven't even started. And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw. Whether it's 6 or 5, but it looks like it's 6, $6 trillion in the Middle East, we could have rebuilt our country twice. \nAnd it's really a shame. And it's politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We're a debtor nation. We're a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas. \nHOLT: We'll let you respond and we'll move on to the next segment. \nCLINTON: And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. (APPLAUSE) \nAnd the other thing I think is important... \nTRUMP: It would be squandered, too, believe me. \nCLINTON: ... is if your -- if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. \nAnd, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. \nWe have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do... \nTRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work... \nCLINTON: Well, to... \nTRUMP: Which our country should do, too. \nCLINTON: Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them? \nI can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. \nAnd when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once. You call yourself the King of Debt. You talk about leverage. You even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States. \nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong. \nCLINTON: Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. \nHOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump... \nCLINTON: And we need to be very clear about that. \nTRUMP: So, yeah, I think -- I do think it's time. Look, it's all words, it's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company. Some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world, beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. \nBut on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation. \nNow, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do. \nBut what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I'll give you an example. We're just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don't get there one way, I'm going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. \nBut we're opening the Old Post Office. Under budget, ahead of schedule, saved tremendous money. I'm a year ahead of schedule. And that's what this country should be doing. \nWe build roads and they cost two and three and four times what they're supposed to cost. We buy products for our military and they come in at costs that are so far above what they were supposed to be, because we don't have people that know what they're doing. \nWhen we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. The Trump International is way under budget and way ahead of schedule. And we should be able to do that for our country. \nHOLT: Well, we're well behind schedule, so I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race. \nThe share of Americans who say race relations are bad in this country is the highest it's been in decades, much of it amplified by shootings of African-Americans by police, as we've seen recently in Charlotte and Tulsa. Race has been a big issue in this campaign, and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap. \nSo how do you heal the divide? Secretary Clinton, you get two minutes on this. \nCLINTON: Well, you're right. Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte. \nAnd we've got to do several things at the same time. We have to restore trust between communities and the police. We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary. Everyone should be respected by the law, and everyone should respect the law. \nCLINTON: Right now, that's not the case in a lot of our neighborhoods. So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform. I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system. \nBut we also have to recognize, in addition to the challenges that we face with policing, there are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform. So we have to bring communities together in order to begin working on that as a mutual goal. And we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. \nThe gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together. So we have to do two things, as I said. We have to restore trust. We have to work with the police. We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them. And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence, which is a big contributor to a lot of the problems that we're seeing today. \nHOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. How do you heal the divide? \nTRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. And we need law and order. If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country. \nAnd when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's -- I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long -- we need law and order in our country. \nI just got today the, as you know, the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, we just -- just came in. We have endorsements from, I think, almost every police group, very -- I mean, a large percentage of them in the United States. \nWe have a situation where we have our inner cities, African- Americans, Hispanics are living in he'll because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. \nIn Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings, thousands since January 1st. Thousands of shootings. And I'm saying, where is this? Is this a war-torn country? What are we doing? And we have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago, where thousands of people have been killed, thousands over the last number of years, in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president, over -- almost 4,000 people in Chicago have been killed. We have to bring back law and order. \nNow, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn't be having it. \nWe have gangs roaming the street. And in many cases, they're illegally here, illegal immigrants. And they have guns. And they shoot people. And we have to be very strong. And we have to be very vigilant. \nWe have to be -- we have to know what we're doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities, because African-American communities are being decimated by crime, decimated. \nHOLT: Your two -- your two minutes expired, but I do want to follow up. Stop-and-frisk was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men. \nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it's allowed. \nHOLT: The argument is that it's a form of racial profiling. \nTRUMP: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn't have them. \nThese are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn't be -- when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. \nYou need more police. You need a better community, you know, relation. You don't have good community relations in Chicago. It's terrible. I have property there. It's terrible what's going on in Chicago. \nBut when you look -- and Chicago's not the only -- you go to Ferguson, you go to so many different places. You need better relationships. I agree with Secretary Clinton on this. TRUMP: You need better relationships between the communities and the police, because in some cases, it's not good. \nBut you look at Dallas, where the relationships were really studied, the relationships were really a beautiful thing, and then five police officers were killed one night very violently. So there's some bad things going on. Some really bad things. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton... \nTRUMP: But we need -- Lester, we need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I've heard -- I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire negative picture of black communities in our country. \nTRUMP: Ugh. \nCLINTON: You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids. There's a lot that we should be proud of and we should be supporting and lifting up. \nBut we do always have to make sure we keep people safe. There are the right ways of doing it, and then there are ways that are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective. It did not do what it needed to do. \nNow, I believe in community policing. And, in fact, violent crime is one-half of what it was in 1991. Property crime is down 40 percent. We just don't want to see it creep back up. We've had 25 years of very good cooperation. \nBut there were some problems, some unintended consequences. Too many young African-American and Latino men ended up in jail for nonviolent offenses. And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated. So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system. We cannot just say law and order. We have to say -- we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little. \nWe need to have more second chance programs. I'm glad that we're ending private prisons in the federal system; I want to see them ended in the state system. You shouldn't have a profit motivation to fill prison cells with young Americans. So there are some positive ways we can work on this. \nAnd I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us. Right now -- and this is something Donald has supported, along with the gun lobby -- right now, we've got too many military- style weapons on the streets. In a lot of places, our police are outgunned. We need comprehensive background checks, and we need to keep guns out of the hands of those who will do harm. \nAnd we finally need to pass a prohibition on anyone who's on the terrorist watch list from being able to buy a gun in our country. If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. So there are things we can do, and we ought to do it in a bipartisan way. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton, last week, you said we've got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Do you believe that police are implicitly biased against black people? \nCLINTON: Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police. I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other. And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way? \nBut when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers. \nI've met with a group of very distinguished, experienced police chiefs a few weeks ago. They admit it's an issue. They've got a lot of concerns. Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street. \nCLINTON: They want support, they want more training, they want more assistance. And I think the federal government could be in a position where we would offer and provide that. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump... \nTRUMP: I'd like to respond to that. \nHOLT: Please. \nTRUMP: First of all, I agree, and a lot of people even within my own party want to give certain rights to people on watch lists and no- fly lists. I agree with you. When a person is on a watch list or a no-fly list, and I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I'm very proud of. These are very, very good people, and they're protecting the Second Amendment. \nBut I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn't be on there, we'll help them, we'll help them legally, we'll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. \nI do want to bring up the fact that you were the one that brought up the words super-predator about young black youth. And that's a term that I think was a -- it's -- it's been horribly met, as you know. I think you've apologized for it. But I think it was a terrible thing to say. \nAnd when it comes to stop-and-frisk, you know, you're talking about takes guns away. Well, I'm talking about taking guns away from gangs and people that use them. And I don't think -- I really don't think you disagree with me on this, if you want to know the truth. \nI think maybe there's a political reason why you can't say it, but I really don't believe -- in New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders. Five hundred murders is a lot of murders. It's hard to believe, 500 is like supposed to be good? \nBut we went from 2,200 to 500. And it was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg. And it was terminated by current mayor. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. \nCLINTON: Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is... \nTRUMP: No, you're wrong. You're wrong. \nCLINTON: No, I'm not. \nTRUMP: Murders are up. All right. You check it. \nCLINTON: New York -- New York has done an excellent job. And I give credit -- I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked. And other communities need to come together to do what will work, as well. \nLook, one murder is too many. But it is important that we learn about what has been effective. And not go to things that sound good that really did not have the kind of impact that we would want. Who disagrees with keeping neighborhoods safe? \nBut let's also add, no one should disagree about respecting the rights of young men who live in those neighborhoods. And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem. \nHOLT: This conversation is about race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you for five... \nTRUMP: I'd like to just respond, if I might. \nHOLT: Please -- 20 seconds. \nTRUMP: I'd just like to respond. \nHOLT: Please respond, then I've got a quick follow-up for you. \nTRUMP: I will. Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election, they said, see ya later, I'll see you in four years. \nThe African-American community -- because -- look, the community within the inner cities has been so badly treated. They've been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that's what it is. They've controlled these communities for up to 100 years. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, let me... \n(CROSSTALK) \nCLINTON: Well, I -- I do think... \nTRUMP: And I will tell you, you look at the inner cities -- and I just left Detroit, and I just left Philadelphia, and I just -- you know, you've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that's OK. But I will tell you, I've been all over. And I've met some of the greatest people I'll ever meet within these communities. And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, I... \nCLINTON: I think -- I think -- I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing. \n(APPLAUSE) \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation's first black president was not a natural-born citizen. You questioned his legitimacy. In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States. Can you tell us what took you so long? \nTRUMP: I'll tell you very -- well, just very simple to say. Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close -- very close friend of Secretary Clinton. And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to -- during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard. And you can go look it up, and you can check it out. \nTRUMP: And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened. Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it. They were pressing it very hard. She failed to get the birth certificate. \nWhen I got involved, I didn't fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I'm satisfied with it. And I'll tell you why I'm satisfied with it. \nHOLT: That was... \n(CROSSTALK) \nTRUMP: Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country. \nHOLT: I will let you respond. It's important. But I just want to get the answer here. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You've continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, '13, '14, '15... \nTRUMP: Yeah. \nHOLT: .... as recently as January. So the question is, what changed your mind? \nTRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it. I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job. \nSecretary Clinton also fought it. I mean, you know -- now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that's not true. Look, it's true. Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter -- you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager. And she was involved. But just like she can't bring back jobs, she can't produce. \nHOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going to follow up -- and I will let you respond to that, because there's a lot there. But we're talking about racial healing in this segment. What do you say to Americans, people of color who... \n(CROSSTALK) \nTRUMP: Well, it was very -- I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. \nBut let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I've developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that. \nAnd I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion. And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, just listen to what you heard. \n(LAUGHTER) \nAnd clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed. \nBut it can't be dismissed that easily. He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen. There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it. \nBut, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy. He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department. \nSo he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior. And the birther lie was a very hurtful one. You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity. And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him. \nBut I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high. And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump's best efforts to bring him down. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond and we're going to move on to the next segment. \nTRUMP: I would love to respond. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect. And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn't work that way. You were after him, you were trying to -- you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures. I don't think you can deny that. \nBut just last week, your campaign manager said it was true. So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work. It really doesn't. \nNow, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father's company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country -- it was a federal lawsuit -- were sued. We settled the suit with zero -- with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. \nTRUMP: I notice you bring that up a lot. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don't do on you. Maybe I'm trying to save the money. \nBut, frankly, I look -- I look at that, and I say, isn't that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it's just one of those things. \nI'll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it's a tremendously successful club. And I'm so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I'm very, very proud of it. And that's the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. \nHOLT: Our next segment is called \"Securing America.\" We want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country. Our institutions are under cyber attack, and our secrets are being stolen. So my question is, who's behind it? And how do we fight it? \nSecretary Clinton, this answer goes to you. \nCLINTON: Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries. There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money. \nBut increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states, organs of states. The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia. There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin, but Putin is playing a really... \n(CROSSTALK) \nCLINTON: ... tough, long game here. And one of the things he's done is to let loose cyber attackers to hack into government files, to hack into personal files, hack into the Democratic National Committee. And we recently have learned that, you know, that this is one of their preferred methods of trying to wreak havoc and collect information. We need to make it very clear -- whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else -- the United States has much greater capacity. And we are not going to sit idly by and permit state actors to go after our information, our private-sector information or our public-sector information. \nAnd we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have. We don't want to engage in a different kind of warfare. But we will defend the citizens of this country. \nAnd the Russians need to understand that. I think they've been treating it as almost a probing, how far would we go, how much would we do. And that's why I was so -- I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans. That is just unacceptable. It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information -- in administrations... \nHOLT: Your two minutes have expired. \nCLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander- in-chief. It's comments like that that really worry people who understand the threats that we face. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes and the same question. Who's behind it? And how do we fight it? \nTRUMP: I do want to say that I was just endorsed -- and more are coming next week -- it will be over 200 admirals, many of them here -- admirals and generals endorsed me to lead this country. That just happened, and many more are coming. And I'm very proud of it. \nIn addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They've never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. I was just recently endorsed -- 16,500 Border Patrol agents. \nSo when Secretary Clinton talks about this, I mean, I'll take the admirals and I'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge. OK? Because look at the mess that we're in. Look at the mess that we're in. \nAs far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we're not. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't -- maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? \nTRUMP: You don't know who broke in to DNC. \nBut what did we learn with DNC? We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people, by Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Look what happened to her. But Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of. That's what we learned. \nNow, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over. \nWe came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game. ISIS. \nSo we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is -- it is a huge problem. I have a son. He's 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it's unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it's hardly doable. \nBut I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that's true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better, Lester, and certainly cyber is one of them. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I think there are a number of issues that we should be addressing. I have put forth a plan to defeat ISIS. It does involve going after them online. I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere. \nBut we also have to intensify our air strikes against ISIS and eventually support our Arab and Kurdish partners to be able to actually take out ISIS in Raqqa, end their claim of being a Caliphate. \nWe're making progress. Our military is assisting in Iraq. And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria. \nBut we have to be cognizant of the fact that they've had foreign fighters coming to volunteer for them, foreign money, foreign weapons, so we have to make this the top priority. \nAnd I would also do everything possible to take out their leadership. I was involved in a number of efforts to take out Al Qaida leadership when I was secretary of state, including, of course, taking out bin Laden. And I think we need to go after Baghdadi, as well, make that one of our organizing principles. Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online. \nHOLT: You mention ISIS, and we think of ISIS certainly as over there, but there are American citizens who have been inspired to commit acts of terror on American soil, the latest incident, of course, the bombings we just saw in New York and New Jersey, the knife attack at a mall in Minnesota, in the last year, deadly attacks in San Bernardino and Orlando. I'll ask this to both of you. Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump? \nTRUMP: Well, first I have to say one thing, very important. Secretary Clinton is talking about taking out ISIS. \"We will take out ISIS.\" Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out -- what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster. And ISIS was formed. \nSo she talks about taking them out. She's been doing it a long time. She's been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn't have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn't have had them. \nOr, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil -- and we should have taken the oil -- ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil -- a lot of the oil in Libya, which was another one of her disasters. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I hope the fact-checkers are turning up the volume and really working hard. Donald supported the invasion of Iraq. \nTRUMP: Wrong. \nCLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again. \nTRUMP: Wrong. Wrong. \nCLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya and urged that Gadhafi be taken out, after actually doing some business with him one time. \nLINTON: But the larger point -- and he says this constantly -- is George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama. \nAnd the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq is to get an agreement from the then-Iraqi government that would have protected our troops, and the Iraqi government would not give that. \nBut let's talk about the question you asked, Lester. The question you asked is, what do we do here in the United States? That's the most important part of this. How do we prevent attacks? How do we protect our people? \nAnd I think we've got to have an intelligence surge, where we are looking for every scrap of information. I was so proud of law enforcement in New York, in Minnesota, in New Jersey. You know, they responded so quickly, so professionally to the attacks that occurred by Rahami. And they brought him down. And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit. \nSo we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East. That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, and that's something that Donald has been very dismissive of. \nWe're working with NATO, the longest military alliance in the history of the world, to really turn our attention to terrorism. We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations. Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community. \nThey're on the front lines. They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else. They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump... \nTRUMP: Well, I have to respond. \nHOLT: Please respond. \nTRUMP: The secretary said very strongly about working with -- we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen. You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess. Under your direction, to a large extent. \nBut you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going. \nBut when you look at NATO, I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO? And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson. I did really well. But I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things. \nNumber one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share. Number two -- and that bothers me, because we should be asking -- we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. \nAnd, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because -- and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest -- but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. \nAnd about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that's great. And I think we should get -- because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also. \nAnd they're going to do that. And that was -- believe me -- I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it -- but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. \nI think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it. They said... \nCLINTON: Lester, we've covered... \nTRUMP: No, wait a minute. \nCLINTON: We've covered this ground. \nTRUMP: When they formed, when they formed, this is something that never should have happened. It should have never happened. Now, you're talking about taking out ISIS. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it's in over 30 countries. And you're going to stop them? I don't think so. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions. You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion. What makes your... \nTRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq. \nHOLT: In 2002... \nTRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she -- frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. \nHOLT: My question is, since you supported it... \nTRUMP: Just -- would you like to hear... \nHOLT: ... why is your -- why is your judgment... \nTRUMP: Wait a minute. I was against the war in Iraq. Just so you put it out. \nHOLT: The record shows otherwise, but why -- why was... \nTRUMP: The record does not show that. \nHOLT: Why was -- is your judgment any... \nTRUMP: The record shows that I'm right. When I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly, first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly, I don't know, maybe, who knows? Essentially. I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto. We talked about the economy is more important. I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity. I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox. And Sean Hannity said -- and he called me the other day -- and I spoke to him about it -- he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war. \nHOLT: Why is your judgment better than... \nTRUMP: And when he -- excuse me. And that was before the war started. Sean Hannity said very strongly to me and other people -- he's willing to say it, but nobody wants to call him. I was against the war. He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war. \nAnd I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity. And then they did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started. I think in '04. But they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq. \nAnd one of your compatriots said, you know, whether it was before or right after, Trump was definitely -- because if you read this article, there's no doubt. But if somebody -- and I'll ask the press -- if somebody would call up Sean Hannity, this was before the war started. He and I used to have arguments about the war. I said, it's a terrible and a stupid thing. It's going to destabilize the Middle East. And that's exactly what it's done. It's been a disaster. \nHOLT: My reference was to what you had said in 2002, and my question was... \nTRUMP: No, no. You didn't hear what I said. \nHOLT: Why is your judgment -- why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment? \nTRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There's no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? \n(LAUGHTER) \nI have a much better -- she spent -- let me tell you -- she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising -- you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names -- oh, temperament, let's go after -- I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a... \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nTRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don't know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there's a person with a temperament that's got a problem. \nHOLT: Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Whew, OK. \n(LAUGHTER) \nLet's talk about two important issues that were briefly mentioned by Donald, first, NATO. You know, NATO as a military alliance has something called Article 5, and basically it says this: An attack on one is an attack on all. And you know the only time it's ever been invoked? After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side. \nWith respect to Iran, when I became secretary of state, Iran was weeks away from having enough nuclear material to form a bomb. They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration. They had built covert facilities. They had stocked them with centrifuges that were whirling away. \nAnd we had sanctioned them. I voted for every sanction against Iran when I was in the Senate, but it wasn't enough. So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran. \nAnd we did drive them to the negotiating table. And my successor, John Kerry, and President Obama got a deal that put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot. That's diplomacy. That's coalition-building. That's working with other nations. \nThe other day, I saw Donald saying that there were some Iranian sailors on a ship in the waters off of Iran, and they were taunting American sailors who were on a nearby ship. He said, you know, if they taunted our sailors, I'd blow them out of the water and start another war. That's not good judgment. \nTRUMP: That would not start a war. \nCLINTON: That is not the right temperament to be commander-in- chief, to be taunted. And the worst part... \nTRUMP: No, they were taunting us. \nCLINTON: ... of what we heard Donald say has been about nuclear weapons. He has said repeatedly that he didn't care if other nations got nuclear weapons, Japan, South Korea, even Saudi Arabia. It has been the policy of the United States, Democrats and Republicans, to do everything we could to reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons. He even said, well, you know, if there were nuclear war in East Asia, well, you know, that's fine... \nTRUMP: Wrong. \nCLINTON: ... have a good time, folks. \nTRUMP: It's lies. \nCLINTON: And, in fact, his cavalier attitude about nuclear weapons is so deeply troubling. That is the number-one threat we face in the world. And it becomes particularly threatening if terrorists ever get their hands on any nuclear material. So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes, as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned. \nTRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to... \nCLINTON: It's a good one, though. It well describes the problem. \n(LAUGHTER) \nTRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all. It's not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things -- and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your -- your president thinks. \nNuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune. That's why we're losing -- we're losing -- we lose on everything. I say, who makes these -- we lose on everything. All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing. We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million... \nHOLT: We need to move on. \nTRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very important. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We're a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. \nHOLT: Our last... \nTRUMP: As far as the nuclear is concerned, I agree. It is the single greatest threat that this country has. \nHOLT: Which leads to my next question, as we enter our last segment here (inaudible) the subject of securing America. On nuclear weapons, President Obama reportedly considered changing the nation's longstanding policy on first use. Do you support the current policy? Mr. Trump, you have two minutes on that. \nTRUMP: Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their -- they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. \nI looked the other night. I was seeing B-52s, they're old enough that your father, your grandfather could be flying them. We are not -- we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. \nI think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it's over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can't take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. \nAnd by the way, another one powerful is the worst deal I think I've ever seen negotiated that you started is the Iran deal. Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Iran has power over North Korea. \nAnd when they made that horrible deal with Iran, they should have included the fact that they do something with respect to North Korea. And they should have done something with respect to Yemen and all these other places. \nAnd when asked to Secretary Kerry, why didn't you do that? Why didn't you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody's ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way. \nSo you say to yourself, why didn't they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. The deal with Iran will lead to nuclear problems. All they have to do is sit back 10 years, and they don't have to do much. \nHOLT: Your two minutes is expired. \nTRUMP: And they're going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he's not a happy camper. \nHOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. \nCLINTON: Well, let me -- let me start by saying, words matter. Words matter when you run for president. And they really matter when you are president. And I want to reassure our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere that we have mutual defense treaties and we will honor them. \nIt is essential that America's word be good. And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe. I've talked with a number of them. But I want to -- on behalf of myself, and I think on behalf of a majority of the American people, say that, you know, our word is good. \nIt's also important that we look at the entire global situation. There's no doubt that we have other problems with Iran. But personally, I'd rather deal with the other problems having put that lid on their nuclear program than still to be facing that. \nAnd Donald never tells you what he would do. Would he have started a war? Would he have bombed Iran? If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be. But it's like his plan to defeat ISIS. He says it's a secret plan, but the only secret is that he has no plan. \nSo we need to be more precise in how we talk about these issues. People around the word follow our presidential campaigns so closely, trying to get hints about what we will do. Can they rely on us? Are we going to lead the world with strength and in accordance with our values? That's what I intend to do. I intend to be a leader of our country that people can count on, both here at home and around the world, to make decisions that will further peace and prosperity, but also stand up to bullies, whether they're abroad or at home. \nWe cannot let those who would try to destabilize the world to interfere with American interests and security... \nHOLT: Your two minutes is... \nCLINTON: ... to be given any opportunities at all. \nHOLT: ... is expired. \nTRUMP: Lester, one thing I'd like to say. \nHOLT: Very quickly. Twenty seconds. \nTRUMP: I will go very quickly. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump... \nTRUMP: And it's a big problem. And as far as Japan is concerned, I want to help all of our allies, but we are losing billions and billions of dollars. We cannot be the policemen of the world. We cannot protect countries all over the world... \nHOLT: We have just... \nTRUMP: ... where they're not paying us what we need. \nHOLT: We have just a few final questions... \nTRUMP: And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn't have that. All of the things that she's talking about could have been taken care of during the last 10 years, let's say, while she had great power. But they weren't taken care of. And if she ever wins this race, they won't be taken care of. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, \"a presidential look.\" She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that? \nTRUMP: She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. \nHOLT: The quote was, \"I just don't think she has the presidential look.\" \nTRUMP: You have -- wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lester. You asked me a question. Did you ask me a question? \nYou have to be able to negotiate our trade deals. You have to be able to negotiate, that's right, with Japan, with Saudi Arabia. I mean, can you imagine, we're defending Saudi Arabia? And with all of the money they have, we're defending them, and they're not paying? All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don't believe that Hillary has the stamina. \nHOLT: Let's let her respond. CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. \n(APPLAUSE) \nTRUMP: The world -- let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last -- so she's got experience, that I agree. \n(APPLAUSE) \nBut it's bad, bad experience. Whether it's the Iran deal that you're so in love with, where we gave them $150 billion back, whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's anything you can -- name -- you almost can't name a good deal. I agree. She's got experience, but it's bad experience. And this country can't afford to have another four years of that kind of experience. \nHOLT: We are at -- we are at the final question. \n(APPLAUSE) \nCLINTON: Well, one thing. One thing, Lester. \nHOLT: Very quickly, because we're at the final question now. \nCLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said... \nTRUMP: I never said that. \nCLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. \nTRUMP: I didn't say that. \nCLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman \"Miss Piggy.\" Then he called her \"Miss Housekeeping,\" because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. \nTRUMP: Where did you find this? Where did you find this? \nCLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado. \nTRUMP: Where did you find this? \nCLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet... \nTRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November. \nTRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you... \n(APPLAUSE) \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just take 10 seconds and then we ask the final question... \nTRUMP: You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it's said in entertainment. Some of it's said -- somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. \nBut you want to know the truth? I was going to say something... \nHOLT: Please very quickly. \nTRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, \"I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.\" But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations. \nAnd I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that. \nBut it's certainly not a nice thing that she's done. It's hundreds of millions of ads. And the only gratifying thing is, I saw the polls come in today, and with all of that money... \nHOLT: We have to move on to the final question. \nTRUMP: ... $200 million is spent, and I'm either winning or tied, and I've spent practically nothing. \n(APPLAUSE) \nHOLT: One of you will not win this election. So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters? Secretary Clinton? \nCLINTON: Well, I support our democracy. And sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I certainly will support the outcome of this election. \nAnd I know Donald's trying very hard to plant doubts about it, but I hope the people out there understand: This election's really up to you. It's not about us so much as it is about you and your families and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it, because I think it does. \nHOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly, same question. Will you accept the outcome as the will of the voters? TRUMP: I want to make America great again. We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country. \nThe other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps they passed the wrong button, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption, but these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know. \nHOLT: Will you accept the outcome of the election? \nTRUMP: Look, here's the story. I want to make America great again. I'm going to be able to do it. I don't believe Hillary will. The answer is, if she wins, I will absolutely support her. \n(APPLAUSE) \nHOLT: All right. Well, that is going to do it for us. That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one. We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would. \nThe next presidential debates are scheduled for October 9th at Washington University in St. Louis and October 19th at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. The conversation will continue. \nA reminder. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for October 4th at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia.

Rahami became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. NBC News has learned that U.S. officials didn't check his social media accounts at that time. An Obama administration official acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security was not checking social media at that time, and only recently began a pilot program to do so. If they had checked his accounts, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News, they would have found multiple links to radical jihadi videos. Rahami and other members of his family brought a civil discrimination suit in federal district court in 2011, alleging they were harassed for being Muslim. The dispute was about noise from the restaurant, which stayed open late, but the Rahami suit quoted the neighbors as saying, \"Muslims make too much trouble in this country.\" The suit references a previous arrest of Rahami's brother Mohammad for assaulting a police officer. Rahami visited Quetta, Pakistan, considered a high-risk area by the government, in late 2011, staying six months. He received a \"secondary inspection\" from U.S. officials on his return. Rahami, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, said he was attending a wedding and visiting family. Rahami married an Afghan national named Asia Bibi while in Quetta, according to two senior U.S. intelligence officials. Before his return to the U.S., he contacted his congressman and asked for assistance bringing his new wife to the U.S. That request was forwarded to the State Department and USCIS, a part of the Department of Homeland Security. Because she held an expired passport and was pregnant, her visa was delayed. She subsequently received a visa to enter the United States after she gave birth to a boy. She was vetted by U.S. intelligence upon granting of a visa and entry to the U.S. in 2014 as a green card holder. Back in New Jersey, according to published accounts, an ex-girlfriend with whom he had a child took out a restraining order against Rahami in 2012. He later violated the order. \nIn 2012, according to a federal criminal complaint filed against him after the Chelsea bombing, Rahami applied for and received a new U.S. passport. There was again no probe of his social media. \nRahami returned to Pakistan in April 2013 and stayed nearly a year. He lived with family in Quetta. During this time, he traveled to Turkey and Afghanistan and U.S. intelligence also believes that he traveled to Syria, attempting to join foreign fighters. His biometrics \u2014 iris and fingerprints \u2014 would have been taken on entry to Afghanistan, as has been required of all U.S. visitors since the May 2011 U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. That information is shared by the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nWhile Rahami was in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere in 2013 and 2014, his siblings were posting pro-jihadi comments on social media. One posted a quote from U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, the recruiter and propagandist for al Qaeda in Yemen who was killed by a U.S. air strike in September 2011. A senior intelligence official confirms the man on the right in this photo is the suspect. The photo is from his brother's Facebook page and it was taken during Ahmad's 2013 trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Facebook \nRahami's brother, the same one who was arrested for allegedly fighting with a police officer, visited Pakistan during this period. He is now believed to be living in Pakistan. \nUpon returning to the U.S. in 2014, Ahmad Rahami was required to go through secondary screening again and interviewed. According to the New York Times, his travel and interview provoked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue a TECS tip-off message to the National Targeting Center, a flag that automatically notifies authorities of any subsequent international and domestic air travel. The TECS system serves as an early warning system for officials who compile watchlists and the FBI. \nIn August 2014, Rahami was charged in New Jersey with aggravated assault and unlawful possession of a weapon and was released after posting $25,000 bail because of an alleged attack on his brother with a knife. Law enforcement and intelligence sources state that he stabbed his brother Nasim in the leg and hit his mother Najiba. He spent three days in jail. Charges were pursued, a grand jury was convened, but ultimately the victim recanted. \nAs part of the August 2014 fracas, a neighbor heard Rahami's father call him a terrorist. The neighbor told the local police, the police told the Union County prosecutors, and the prosecutors informed the Newark Joint Terrorism Task Force. When the FBI went to question the father, he said he spoke in anger and did not believe his son was a terrorist, though he was concerned that his son was hanging around with the wrong kind of people, maybe gang members. According to the official FBI statement: \"In August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities. The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism.\" \nFBI agents approached Ahmad Rahami as part of the inquiry, but he refused to talk to them. \nAccording to a federal criminal complaint filed against him earlier this week, and a senior intelligence official, at the time of the initial FBI probe, Ahmad -- and possibly unnamed accomplices -- had more than one YouTube channel (Yaafghankid786, among others) and designated radicalized videos as \"favorites.\" Play ", "Sep 15 2016, 4:26 pm ET Trump's 25 Million New Jobs Promise Doesn't Add Up by John W.

In a post on his website, he promised to raise the growth of U.S. gross domestic product to 3.5 percent a year, nearly double the average pace so far this century. \nIn his remarks, he suggested a 4 percent growth target was achievable. \n\"My great economists don't want me to say this, but I think we can do better than that,\" he said. \nWith a series of tax cuts and a moratorium on federal regulations, the GOP candidate promised that a Trump economy would also expand U.S. payrolls by 25 million new jobs over the next decade, harkening back to a period when the economy grew at a more rapid pace. advertisement \n\"Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5 percent growth rate,\" he said. \"But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent..\" \nBut beyond globalization, a lot has changed closer to home since those post-War boom to slow the growth of the American economy. That includes a slowdown in the growth in of the workforce. \n\"In the post World War II period, we had very strong labor force growth - especially with women entering the workforce in large numbers,\" said Chad Stone, chief economist at The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Especially in the absence of immigration, those demographic trends are going to be impossible to replicate.\" Play Trump proposes $4.4 trillion tax cut 3:15 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/765990979531\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> advertisement \nTo be sure, millions of workers who gave up looking for a job after the Great Depression have been returning to the workforce, offsetting some of the demographic headwinds. \nBut an ongoing wave of aging baby boomers is leaving the labor force for good, reducing the number of workers available to fill new jobs. CNBC \nMoreover, Trump's promise to close the door to new immigrants if he wins the election \u2014 and immediately deport millions of undocumented workers \u2014 would actually shrink the labor force. advertisement \nIn March, American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute led by former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated it would take between $100 billion and $300 billion to arrest and remove \"all undocumented immigrants residing in the country, a process that we estimate would take 20 years,\" the group said. \nAAF estimated the removal of that many people would shrink the pool of U.S. workers by 6.4 percent, which means that 20 years from now the U.S. economy would be nearly 6 percent cent smaller. That works out to a loss of $1.6 trillion in lost wages, spending and other economic activity. \nTo put that in perspective, the gross domestic product for Texas last year was about $1.5 trillion, second behind California. \nWhile this impact would be felt across the country and throughout the economy, sectors such as agriculture, construction, retail and hospitality would be hardest hit, the AAF reported \nIn fact, employers are already having a hard time filling some new positions, based on the latest government data, which is one reason wages have begun rising again after nearly a decade of stagnation. CNBC \nThe number of monthly job openings rose again in July, to 5.9 million, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said earlier this month. That works out to a rate of 3.9 percent of overall employment, tied with a level hit last July. That rate of openings is higher than the early 2000s and was last seen in January of 2001, at the tail end of the 1990s dotcom boom. \n\"Despite the slowdown in payroll gains in August, labor market conditions continue to tighten, which should eventually generate a pick-up in wage growth later this year,\" according to Steve Murphy, an economist at Capital Economics. \nEmployers posted 5.9 million job openings in July, a rate of 3.9 percent, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) report. That compares to 5.62 million job openings in June, according to Thomson Reuters. \nThe survey, which tracks the number of open positions along with how many workers have been hired, fired or just up and quit their jobs, gets much less attention than the high-profile payroll and jobless rate data that comes out on the first Friday of every month.

Monica Alba ", "File Photo: Opponents of the Affordable Care Act rally before the Supreme announces its decision about the constitutionality of the president's efforts on... Chris Maddaloni/CQ Roll Call, File \nThis story was originally published on NBCNews.com . \nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law remains unpopular with the American public just months before it fully goes into effect, according to the new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \nThe poll shows 49 percent of Americans say they believe the Affordable Care Act is a bad idea. That\u2019s the highest number recorded on this question since the poll began measuring it in 2009. Just 37 percent say the plan is a good idea. \nAs the political battle over implementation of the law heats up in Washington, the numbers mark an increase in unpopularity since July 2012, right after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obama\u2019s overhaul. Back then, 44 percent of NBC/WSJ poll respondents called it a bad idea, vs. 40 percent who called it a good one. \nGOP leaders have been unrelenting in their calls to reverse the law. \u201cFor the sake of my constituents in Kentucky and for the sake of Americans across the country, I urge my friends on the other side to join with Republicans and stop this \u2018train wreck\u2019 before things get even worse,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor in April. \nObama countered earlier this year, \u201cDespite all the hue and cry and \u2018sky is falling\u2019 predictions about this stuff, if you\u2019ve already got health insurance, then that part of Obamacare that affects you, it\u2019s pretty much already in place. And that\u2019s about 85 percent of the country.\u201d \n\u201cWhat is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the 10 to 15 percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they don\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d he added. \nFor individuals, the current poll also finds 38 percent of respondents saying that they (and their families) will be worse off under the health care law. That\u2019s the highest percentage of respondents to express a negative outlook toward \u201cObamacare\u201d since 2010, when the president signed this signature piece of legislation into law following an extended, bruising battle in Congress. \nBy comparison, 19 percent say they\u2019ll be better off, and 39 percent say the law won\u2019t make much of a difference. \nThe poll, however, shows deep divisions by political party and health insurance status. \nBy a 35 percent-to-11 percent margin, Democrats say they\u2019ll be better off under the health care law. But Republicans say they\u2019ll be worse off, 67 percent to 4 percent. \nWhat\u2019s more, those who currently don\u2019t have health insurance have a more positive view of the health-care law than those who have insurance \u2013 either through individual purchase or through their employer. \nMajority backs pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants \nMeanwhile, with bipartisan immigration reform legislation expected to hit the Senate floor next week, the NBC/WSJ poll shows a slight majority \u2013 52 percent \u2013 saying they support a proposed pathway to allow undocumented immigrants to become U.S. citizens. \nWhen told that the proposed pathway to citizenship under the legislation includes requirements to pay fines, back taxes and pass a background security check, the percentage favoring it jumps up to 65 percent, including 58 percent of Republicans. \nBut respondents are divided over whether Congress should pass an immigration bill by the end of the current Congress: 47 percent say they would be upset if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a bill, and that includes a majority of Democrats (54 percent). \nBut an equal 47 percent say they wouldn\u2019t be upset if Congress doesn\u2019t pass immigration legislation, and that includes a majority of Republicans (53 percent). \nStrikingly, the partisan divisions have flipped since this question was last asked in 2006, when former President George W. Bush was supporting comprehensive immigration reform. \nBack then, more than six-in-10 Republicans said they would be upset if immigration reform didn\u2019t pass, and an almost equal percentage of Democrats \u2013 who were out of power in the White House \u2013 said they wouldn\u2019t be upset. \nThe NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 30-June 2 of 1,000 adults (including 300 cell phone-only respondents), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.

No evidence was revealed during the course of that time to back up his initial claim. \nBut in his 40-second statement, Trump replaced one conspiracy theory with another by claiming Clinton \"started the birther controversy.\" That is simply not true, according to multiple independent fact checkers , who call the claim \" ridiculous .\" \nAnd now, even some leading birther activists tell NBC News that Clinton was not involved in their effort. \nTrump didn't start the birther movement either, but he was by far its highest-profile spokesperson. \nRelated: Analysis: Trump's Lengthy History of Conspiracy Theories and Rumors \nIn addition, almost all its prominent activists have flocked to Trump's campaign \u2014 from the handful of members of Congress who supported \"birther bills\" to Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who launched an investigation that claimed to prove Obama's birth certificate was a fraud, and Orly Taitz, the dentist and lawyer who the press once dubbed \"the birther queen.\" \nPhil Berg, the Pennsylvania lawyer who brought the very first lawsuit challenging Obama's eligibility to serve as president in August in 2008, was a lifelong Democrat who switched his party registration this year to vote for Trump in the primary.

It's about Obama.\" \nAsked for more evidence that Clinton started the movement, Taitz replied, again referring to Berg, \"This is the evidence that I've seen.\" \nRichard Mack, a former Arizona sheriff and the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, still believes Obama's birth certificate is a forgery. But said he agrees with Trump's decision to drop the issue for now. \"Move on Donald and keep up the fight,\" he said. \"Move on Donald and keep up the fight.\" \n\"Trump had the courage to come out and look at it and agree with Sheriff Arpaio's investigation. Any second grader who saw it would have said the same thing, the evidence was so clear, \" Mack said. \nAsked if he agreed with Trump that Clinton started the birther movement, Mack seemed puzzled, as if he had never thought about it. \"I certainly wouldn't put it past her,\" he said. \"But I have no evidence of that.\" \nAsked who he thought did start the movement, Mack replied, \"I have no idea.\" \nIt's no surprise that Trump has attracted birthers, who say they mostly support him for his stance on immigration, trade, and other issues \u2014 rather than for his beliefs about Obama's birthplace. \nIn fact, as Talking Points Memo reported , one of the men who introduced Trump at his anti-birther press conference Friday has flirted with the conspiracy theory. Retired Air Force Lieutenant General Thomas McInerney once wrote an affidavit stating there are \"widespread and legitimate concerns that the President is constitutionally ineligible to hold office.\" \nRelated: Donald Trump Finally Admits President Obama Born in U.S. \nJerome Corsi, who advanced many theories about Obama's origin at the website World Net Daily, which has paid for giant billboards asking for Obama's birth certificate, declined to comment on Trump's reversal.

Latino Decisions also did the 2012 poll. \nOf those contacted in 2016, more than half were contacted by Democrats. About a quarter said they were reached by Republicans, 16 percent by a non-profit group and 9 percent didn't really know, according to results of the poll done from Sept. 12 to Sept 16. \nRELATED: Latino Groups Partner to Amp Up Voter Numbers \nData was not available from 2012 to compare the shares of Latino voters reached by each party, although representatives from Latino Decisions say those will be available next week. \nHowever, direct comparisons can be made in this poll in enthusiasm for this election among Latino voters and enthusiasm in 2012 compared to 2008. \nFor instance, 48 percent of Latinos said they were more enthusiastic about this year's election than in 2012. A similar question in 2012 showed lower levels of enthusiasm among Latinos, 40 percent, than the previous election in 2008. \nDespite the enthusiasm, 61 percent of Latino registered voters said they have never been contacted, which was reflected in a separate Latino Decisions poll conducted for the liberal immigrant advocacy group America's Voice. It showed Latinos knew little about the position of their state's U.S. Senate candidates on immigration, regardless of whether they are Democrat or Republican. advertisement \nOrganizations insist that Hillary Clinton has disappointed expectations that Donald Trump would be an opportunity for Democrats to dig deeper into the Latino electorate or that she is not doing as well with the community as President Barack Obama had done. With funding for voter outreach reportedly low compared to 2012, fewer resources to make phone calls, send fliers, and knock on doors should also be expected to be reflected in the data. \nRELATED: NCLR Latino Voter Registration Money Fell from $7 Million to $1.5 Million \nIn a recent report by NBCNews, Clarissa Mart\u00ednez de Castro, deputy vice president of the National Council de la Raza (NCLR), said \"we are seeing very weak investments in what we consider a key factor, as a non-profit organization, in growing the Latino vote.\" She expressed concern about expanding the number of Latino registered voters because some 9.6 million did not register and each year about 1 million more U.S.-born Latinos turn 18 and are eligible to vote. \nBut the weaker investments reported by NCLR and other Latino organizations do not appear, at least for now, to be having a negative impact on Latino voters' perception about the campaigns. \nWhen asked if the Democrats were doing a good job of reaching out to Latinos at the same time in 2012 , 55 percent of respondents agreed. The 2016 tracking poll shows a similar assessment of Democrats' outreach this year, with 59 percent saying that Democrats were doing a good job of reaching out to Latinos; a slight uptick, but within the margin of error. \nIn short, Latinos think Democrats are doing a good job in reaching out to Latinos. \nThe poll also showed: \n\u2022 Clinton has a 65 percent favorability rating among Latinos, while Obama has 72 percent. \n\u2022 There has been a significant jump in negativity towards the GOP and its outreach to Latinos. When asked in 2012 if the Republicans were doing a good job of reaching out to Latinos or if the GOP was being hostile, only 20 percent of Latinos said that Republicans were being hostile. This year, 43 percent of Latinos say that the GOP is being hostile. This may be a result of negativity from the Trump campaign. \nNOTE: In August 2015, Matt Barreto and Gary Segura of Latino Decisions were hired as consultants to the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

EL CAJON, Calif. -- It took more than an hourfor police to arrive at the shopping center in a San Diego suburb where a distressed black man had been wandering into traffic. It took about a minute for him to be shot and killed.\nAlfred Olango pulled a large electronic cigarette, known as a vape pen, from his pocket and pointed at the police officer who fired, while a second officer stood nearby trying to subdue him with a stun gun, El Cajon police said.\nThe details emerged Wednesday in the shooting of Olango, who was having an emotional breakdown over the recent death of his best friend, an attorney said.\nThe investigation centered on a video of Tuesday\u2019s shooting taken by a bystander. Police have produced a single frame from the cellphone video to support their account, saying it shows Olango in a\u201cshooting stance.\u201d\nThe photo shows Olango\u2019s hands clasped together and pointed directly at an officer who had assumed a similar posture with his gun a few feet away.\nThe vaping device in his hands had two components, a box about the size of a cellphone and a metallic cylinder that was 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Police said the cylinder was pointed right at the officer.\nOlango\u2019s relatives demanded the full video be released, according to Dan Gilleon, a lawyer who says he is representing the family.\n\u201cThey\u2019re cherry-picking part of the video,\u201d Gilleon said. \u201cThis is exactly what police have said is unfair when only portions of video are released against them.\u201d\nMayor Bill Wells said he had seen the video and that it was not \u201ctremendously complicated to figure out what happened.\u201d\nWells was asked how he would feel if it was his child that had been shot.\n\u201cI saw a man who was distraught,and a man acting like he was in great pain,\u201d Wells said. \u201cAnd I saw him get gunned down and killed.

Since then he ran afoul of the law several times:selling cocaine, driving drunk, and illegally possessing a 9mm semi-automatic handgun when he was arrested in Colorado in 2005 with pot and ecstasy in his car, according to court records. He pleaded guilty in federal court and was sentenced to nearly four years for being a felon in possession of a gun.\nU.S. authorities tried twice to deport Olango but his native Uganda refused to take him.\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday in a statement to The Associated Press that Olango stopped reporting to officers in February 2015. Spokeswoman Virginia Kice didn\u2019t know if officers tried to find him after that.\nThe family eventually moved to Southern California, and Olango attended San Diego High School for a time before dropping out, though he later earned a GED, reports CBS San Diego affiliate KFMB-TV . According to his Facebook page, he also studied at San Diego Mesa College and worked as a cook at a Hooters restaurant.\nThe fatal shooting happened less than two weeks after black men were shot and killed by police in Tulsa , Oklahoma,and Charlotte \u200b, North Carolina, where violent protests broke out.\nProtests in El Cajon Wednesday night had heated moments, but remained mostly peaceful.\nScores of people gathered quietly around candles lining a curb in front of bloodstained pavement at the strip mall where Olango was shot.\nMore than 200 people marched in the streets near the site, yelling \u201cno justice, no peace, no racist police!\u201d\nPolice in riot gear, some of them with dogs, faced off with protesters occasionally, bringing some tense moments, but mostly kept their distance.\nExperts said it was too early to conclude whether the California shooting was justified or could have been prevented.\nChuck Drago, a former Florida police chief who consults about police use of force, said that once Olango struck the shooting pose, officers would have had to react quickly if he drew an unknown object from his pocket.\n\u201cAn officer doesn\u2019t have enough time to wait to determine if that\u2019s a gun in his hand,\u201d Drago said.\u201cIf a person is pointing something at an officer and he believes it\u2019s a gun and it is a gun and that officer doesn\u2019t have his gun out, that officer will lose that gunfight.\u201d\n\u00a9 KFMB-TV/El Cajon police el-cajon-police-shooting-092716.jpg Police have not named the officers involved, though Wells said both were 21-year veterans and one was Officer Richard Gonsalves.\nGonsalves was demoted last year after allegations that he sexually harassed a lesbian colleague.

Trump has stopped falsely suggesting President Obama was not born in the United States, but Clinton is determined to make sure that voters don't forget it. She regularly condemns voter ID laws that have been adopted by Republican governors and legislatures across the country. \nClinton spent much of August attending private fundraisers but returned to the campaign trail to blast Trump for his connections to the \"alt-right\" after the real estate mogul tapped Brietbart's Steve Bannon as one of his top campaign aides. \"I won't stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign.\" \u2014Hillary pic.twitter.com/C3Z7GybJ53 \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 10, 2016 \n\"Trump attacked a federal judge for his Mexican heritage.

He calls women 'pigs' and 'bimbos.' So I'm going to keep calling out the bigotry and hateful rhetoric that he's brought to this campaign,\" Clinton said in a Thursday interview on the Tom Joyner Morning Show. \nShe added, \"I also accept the responsibility of making sure that we do everything we can to try to heal these divides, to bring people together. But it starts by standing up and calling out the bigotry and the hatred that we see coming from Trump.\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 10, 2016 \nHer comments are a big break from the campaigns of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Trying to avoid being defined as a black candidate, Obama rarely directly addressed the birther movement or the broader racial backlash that emerged during his campaigns. \nClinton's emphasis on race is an illustration of both a broader shift in American politics and the specific dynamics of this campaign. Views about race and its role in American life are increasingly driven by partisanship, not race. A recent Pew Research Center poll showed that white Democrats hold similar views to African-Americans on a range of racial issues, such as supporting the Black Lives Matter movement and believing that the United States needs to make more policy changes to ensure blacks have equal opportunities. \nWhite Republicans were much less supportive of Black Lives Matter and were more likely to say that the country has made enough policy changes to ensure equality for blacks. advertisement \nSo Clinton, in taking progressive views on racial issues, is speaking to an issue that unifies her core supporters: white liberals and people of color. About 44 percent of the people who voted for Obama in 2012 were non-white, and Clinton is expected to also rely heavily on minorities.

Volkan Furuncu/Anadolu Agency / Getty Images \nIn this campaign, Trump has exacerbated a divide that was already emerging in American politics: white college graduates versus whites who did not attend college. White college graduates tend to have more liberal views on racial issues. A recent poll by the Brookings Institution and the Public Religion Research Institute showed that 54 percent of whites without a college education supported a ban on Muslim immigration, compared to just 33 percent of whites who attended college. \nMany election analysts have suggested Donald Trump's recent outreach to African-Americans was really aimed at convincing white swing voters that he is not a racist. \nSimilarly, Clinton's strong rhetoric on racial tolerance, while an obvious appeal to people of color, may also be aimed at white swing voters, trying to convince them Trump is a racist that they can't support. advertisement \n\"If economics were dominating this campaign, you'd hear a lot about how Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are selling out the Democrats by cozying up to corporate elites for money and endorsements. But by keeping the campaign about Trump's racism, these divisions have been silenced,\" political scientist Lee Drutman wrote recently. \nHe added, \"Democrats are more and more a coalition of identity groups , all with their specific policy demands.

Melina Mara / The Washington Post/Getty Images \nClinton needs black voters-perhaps even more than Obama did \nTo be sure, Clinton's racial messages are also aimed at minorities. \nPolls suggest Clinton is weaker than Obama among millennials of all races and among white-working class voters in states like Iowa and Nevada. \nIf Clinton can't win Iowa and Nevada, two states with small black populations, she will be more reliant on winning five states with large black populations: Florida (17 percent) North Carolina (23 percent) Ohio (13 percent) Pennsylvania (12 percent) and Virginia (20 percent.) It's not an accident that Clinton's first stop after recovering from pneumonia is in Greensboro, North Carolina. The Tar Heel state was not a core focus for Obama's 2012 campaign, and he narrowly lost the state. \nBut the huge populations of well-educated people in the Raleigh-Durham area and African-Americans in Charlotte (32 percent of the population) make North Carolina an ideal state for Clinton against Trump.

Like most Democratic presidential candidates, she is expected to get about 90 percent of the African-American vote. The question is turnout. In 2012, blacks voted at a higher rate than whites, for the first since the U.S. Census Bureau has been collecting such data. (The black turnout rate was 66 percent, compared to 64 percent for whites.) \nThere has been a lot of anecdotal reporting suggesting that black voters, like many others, are not particularly enthusiastic about Clinton. Such reporting also emerged before the primaries, only for Clinton to overwhelmingly win the black vote over Bernie Sanders in state-after-state. \nThe key demographic for Clinton is older, black women. In 2012, when Obama won with a huge advantage in black votes, 66 percent of black women voted, as did 69 percent of blacks of both sexes who were between ages 45 and 64. In contrast, only 46 percent of blacks between ages 18 and 24 voted, and only 57 percent of black men cast ballots. \nThe Clinton campaign is subtly suggesting that voters, particularly black ones, don't need to like the candidate to strongly support her. Clinton's very enthusiastic and constant praise of Obama and her comments on birtherism and suggestions of Trump's intolerance are directing African-Americans to back her as a way to defend Obama and his legacy and stop Trump. \n\"My concern is just making sure that folks, particularly African-American folks, don't suddenly say, 'well, you know, we're not as excited because Barack and Michelle are leaving, and so we're just going to not register and we're not going to vote.' If we have that attitude, then we will turn back a lot of the progress that's been made,\" Obama said in an interview Tuesday with two black radio hosts in the Miami area, after speaking at a campaign rally for Clinton in Philadelphia.

Can you name a famous Mexican American? \nThursday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs September 15 through October 15. \nThis period includes the anniversaries of independence of several Latin American countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Belize, and Costa Rica) as well as Columbus Day on October 12. \nThe U.S. Latino population is currently estimated at 55 million, and Hispanics are more visible and influential than ever before. \nYet as our video shows, misperceptions about Latinos are not uncommon. \nSo here are five takeaways for Hispanic Heritage Month 2016: 1. Latinos are the largest ethnic/racial group in the U.S. - not the fastest-growing. \nLatinos remain the country's largest ethnic/racial minority group, comprising 17 percent of the U.S. population. \nBut according to Census Bureau figures, Asians are the country's fastest-growing minority group. Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew Hispanic Center noted that, between 2000 and 2010, Latinos and Asians had roughly the same rate of growth. Since then, the U.S. Asian population has been growing faster that the U.S. Latino population. \nRELATED: Asians Remain Fastest-Growing US Group as Pacific Islanders, Mixed-Race Numbers Grow: Census \n\"Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, immigration from Latin America fueled the growth of the Hispanic population. Now this has dropped off, to the point where there are more Mexicans leaving the country than arriving ,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, the U.S.-born Hispanic population has lower fertility rates than immigrants.\" 2. The three states with the largest Latino populations are California, Texas and Florida. \nMore than half of the overall U.S. Latino population reside in these states , with California being home to about 15 million Latinos, Texas to 10 million, and Florida to 4 million. New Mexico has the largest percentage of a state population that is Latino: 48 percent. advertisement \nPew Research's Mark Hugo Lopez told NBC News that he expected these trends to continue, although the growth of the Latino population in California and Texas would likely slow in the future. \nSouthern states like Alabama and Georgia have been strong drivers of Latino population growth; about 43 percent of the growth of the national Latino population was in the southeast. In 2002, the California Voting Rights Act became the first state law that strengthened a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prohibits racial discrimination. Roman Knertser \nPeople might be surprised to know that the fastest-growing counties for Latinos are in North Dakota. Williams County, Stark County and Ward County, North Dakota, all saw their Hispanic populations more than double between 2007 to 2014. Lopez attributes this to North Dakota's oil boom, which has resulted in Latinos moving there to work in the oil industry and in construction. 3. Mexican-Americans comprise almost two-thirds of the U.S. Latino population. advertisement \nMexican-Americans have made their mark in politics and civil rights (HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Cesar Ch\u00e1vez), entertainment (Eva Longoria, George Lopez, Selena ), sports (Mark Sanchez, Oscar de la Hoya) and even in space ( astronaut Jos\u00e9 Hernandez ). \nSo why does the public, at times, seem to be unfamiliar with the contributions of Mexican-Americans? \nRaquel Rubio-Goldsmith of the University of Arizona's Department of Mexican American Studies theorizes that it stems from a lack of education. Mexican-American history is not taught at the elementary and high school levels, she pointed out. \"At most, the curriculums might include a mention of Cesar Chavez .\" \n\"We (Mexican-Americans) have always been like a kind of invisible people. The master narrative comes out of the East Coast, and that leaves us out,\" Rubio-Goldsmith said. \"It is only lately that our numbers are growing so that people are paying attention.\" While there has been some recent growth of Mexican-American Studies programs , she believes that \"we still have a long way to go.\" 4. Most U.S Latinos are native-born. \nDespite the widespread perception that most Latinos are immigrants - a 2012 poll found that Americans erroneously believed that 1 out of 3 Latinos were undocumented immigrants - a majority of U.S. Hispanics were born here. The Migration Policy Institute reports that only 35 percent of Latinos are immigrants. \nCynthia Pleitez of the Hispanic Heritage Foundation said it's important to see beyond outdated stereotypes and assumptions about Latinos. \n\"People should know, for example, that Latinos are very technologically savvy. We over-index for use of social media ,\" Pleitez told NBC News. \"We are people who value technology and entrepreneurship.\" Lilia Hernandez displays a USA hat during Fourth of July festivities at Legoland, California on Tuesday, July 4, 2012 in Carlsbad, California. Sandy Huffaker/Corbis / Corbis via Getty Images \n\"We are not a threat to American culture or values. We (Latinos) are actually a representation of America's core values,\" she said. \"We are a direct succession of what it means to be American. We are here in the country to be a part of it like anybody else.\" 5. A taco truck on every corner might not be a bad idea. \nIn a recent interview with MSNBC , Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump, warned that Latino culture was \"very dominant\" and that \"if you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks on every corner.\" His words lit up social media, and within minutes \"TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner\" was trending on Twitter .

BERNIE SANDERS: \nChuck, you know, the latter part of my statement, which doesn't get recorded very much, is, \"What the American people want to hear about are the real issues impacting their lives, why the middle class is declining, income and wealth inequality, why we are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all people.\" That's what I believed then. That's what I believe now.

BERNIE SANDERS: \nThe top one tenth of 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent Those are the issues I believe we need to focus on, politicians and the media. Let the American get involved in that debate. And I think at the end of the discussion, people will see Clinton as the superior candidate. \nCHUCK TODD: \nI understand that. But you can't govern if you don't have trust. So can she rebuild trust by pledging something to do that? Is it shutting down the foundation? What would you tell her to do? \nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: \nWell, I would certainly suggest that, as president of the United States, she should cease all operations, all contact with the Clinton Foundation. \nCHUCK TODD: \nDoes that mean shutting it down, or just not being involved?

Stay safe, sir. Good to see you. \nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: \nThank you very much, take care. \nCHUCK TODD: \nWhen we come back, why the recent tightening of the polls may not be exactly what it seems to be. Before we go to break, you've got to see this scene from The Vatican earlier this morning. This is where Pope Francis officially elevated Mother Teresa to sainthood. She will now be known as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. We'll be back in a moment. \n***COMMERCIAL BREAK*** \nCHUCK TODD: \nAnd we are back. It's data download time. You may have noticed that Donald Trump has been closing the gap with Hillary Clinton in recent polls. Her post-convention bounce is clearly gone. But it hasn't gone to the direct benefit of Trump. So where has it gone? \nWell, we're going to take a look at polls that were released right after the conventions and then re-released again in the last week. We're going to start with our own poll, NBC News Survey Monkey, that had Clinton at 41 percent this past week. That was down three points immediately from the post-convention in early August. Trump sits at 37 percent. He's down a point from early August. Libertarian Gary Johnson gained a point, Green Party candidate Jill Stein gained a point. And \"no answer\" gained two points. So collectively, Clinton and Trump lost four from the convention bounces, while Johnson and Stein and \"no answer\" gained four. \nNow let's look at the National Monmouth University Poll. That had Clinton down three points from early August. Trump is actually up two from early August. Meanwhile, the combination of Johnson-Stein and all others, that also went up two points. So while Trump has gained in this poll, he doesn't go up as much as Clinton drops. \nNow let's go to the states. We're going to look at Wisconsin, in a new poll from Marquette Law School. Remember, it's a state both candidates lost in the primary. Well, Clinton is down five points from her post-convention lead in this poll in August. Trump is down a point. At the same time, Johnson is up a point, Stein is up three, and \"no preference\" is up two. So again, Clinton and Trump are down six collectively while Johnson, Stein and \"no preference\" are up six. \nAn election where voters are casting their eye toward anyone other than the two major party nominees, Johnson and Stein are having more of an impact on Clinton support than Trump's. It's going to be very interesting over the next few weeks. Number one, does Clinton get these voters back? Number two, are these voters at all in play for Trump? If they didn't go to Trump now, will they ever go to Trump? Or are these voters that are vacillating between Clinton, third party candidates, or not voting at all? \nComing up, if you've been getting emails from someone saying they're desperate for you, they've lost all hope, they need you and they need you now, worry not. It's probably not from a jilted ex-lover. But it is from somebody else. We'll explain. \n***COMMERCIAL BREAK*** \nCHUCK TODD: \nBack now with the panel. We talked about Trump and immigration.

In one of his most passionate and unrelenting speeches targeting the former secretary of state over her foreign policy and the rise of ISIS, the GOP nominee said Clinton is \"not the right person to solve a problem that largely her and Obama gave us!\" \nTo a cheering crowd, he said Clinton's policies \"disqualify her from being a credible presidential candidate, in my opinion. What do I know?\" Trump questioned, before being affirmed by cheers from the crowd when he asked, \"Does everybody agree with me or not?\" \nDespite a recycled use of many of his attack lines, Trump's blows came off more effective and impassioned cast in the new light of these latest attacks. He repeatedly lambasted Clinton, and President Obama, for their reluctance to use the words \"radical Islamic terror,\" a description Trump feels is a key piece of his strategy to combat ISIS. \"Anyone who cannot name our enemy, is not fit to lead this country,\" he said. advertisement \n\"She talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists,\" Trump quipped, referencing Clinton's comments calling Trump supporters \"deplorables.\" Trying a new tactic on these comments, Trump described Clinton as more willing to speak harshly of his supporters \u2014 \"hardworking Americans\" \u2014 than she is of foreign threats and terrorists. \"Has she ever talked that way about radical Islamic terror?\" Trump asked to a resounding \"no\" from the arena. \nTrump's own plan for immigration seeks to implement an ideological test that would admit only people who \"love our country\" and \"our people.\" The GOP nominee has proposed the need for \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants and refugees into the United States and said he plans to temporarily ban Muslims, as well as people from countries where adequate vets cannot be performed and where there is a history of terrorism. Vetting is impossible if ideology is not also examined, he said Monday. The recent bombings only add to the list of international and domestic terror acts that Trump uses to bolster the argument for his policies.

Trump thinks that Syrian refugees arriving in the U.S have it too easy, and that undocumented immigrants are treated better than veterans. He believes that we should institute an \"ideological loyalty test\" for prospective immigrants; never mind that this would likely be unconstitutional. He described some immigrants as a potential \"Trojan Horse,\" and reeled off crimes allegedly committed by undocumented people. advertisement \nWhat Trump did not do was deliver a speech grounded in fact. He ignored the reality that, according to experts and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, our border is more secure and safer than ever. He ignored the reality that illegal immigration is down , with more Mexicans leaving than entering the U.S. He ignored the reality that undocumented immigrants are our friends, family members, colleagues, employees, and neighbors. Instead viewers got a fiery tirade invoking every negative stereotype of what Trump called \"criminal aliens\" and a long list of all the people he plans to deport on Day One. \nTrump stated that the only way that undocumented people might be allowed to adjust their status is if they return to their countries of origin, apply to re-enter legally, and go through a vetting process. But under current immigration law, this is not possible. Anyone who has remained in the U.S. illegally for over six months who leaves the country - for any reason - is automatically subject to a ban on re-entry for three years, ten years , or sometimes permanently. These provisions apply even if someone is leaving to apply for a visa or entry permit at a consulate. \nMeanwhile, consider that 62 percent of the undocumented have lived here for more than a decade, and one-fifth have lived here for more than two decades. Imagine the social and economic disruption if such people were forced back to countries where they no longer belong. So Trump's notion that he will make people leave and then allow the \"good ones\" to come back is as impractical as it is inhumane. \nAs Trump enumerated his ideas, from ending funding for sanctuary cities to increasing the budget for the Border Patrol, he mostly overlooked the fact that such proposals must all go through Congress. That's one reason we do not yet have national mandatory E-Verify or an entry/exit tracking system for visas; lawmakers may like these ideas in theory, but they balk at funding them. Does Trump plan on making Congress pay for programs the same way he intends to make Mexico pay for the wall? Trump's immigration screed veered into blatant falsehoods. advertisement \nAt times, Trump's screed veered into blatant falsehoods. He claimed that undocumented immigrants are a net drain on society, while there is solid research showing otherwise . He ripped into the \"Obama/Clinton\" immigration failures, even though Hillary Clinton, in her former role as Secretary of State, did not set immigration policy. He said that Clinton wants \"open borders for all\" which is not true. For the record , Clinton plans to work with Congress on an overhaul of our immigration system, end immigrant family detention, and use executive action only as a last resort. \nFor undocumented immigrants and their allies, much of Trump's speech was chilling. He vowed to cancel DACA, which has helped thousands of young people live productive lives without fear of deportation. He wants to bring back the troublesome 287(g) and Secure Communities programs, which sowed fear in immigrant communities until President Obama's DHS phased them out . And just in case there were any doubt about what a Trump administration would be like, The Donald was clear: \"Everyone not following immigration laws is subject to deportation.\" He went so far as to suggest that anyone apprehended for immigration violations be detained and deported at once, without the due process required by law. Such disregard for our justice system and civil liberties is staggering. \nHow darkly ironic that this virulent anti-immigrant sentiment comes from a man who has been accused of using illegal workers on his hotels and properties , whose modeling agency allegedly flouted immigration law , who prefers to hire cheaper foreign labor over Americans at his Florida resort , and whose wife has her own immigration controversy . Hostility, meet hypocrisy. \nBasically, Trump's \"new\" immigration policy is what is has been all along, the mobilizing of xenophobia towards immigrants and anyone else his base views as The Other. The only positive takeaway from Trump's proposals was that they exist in a far-right bubble, away from the large majorities of Americans who favor practical immigration solutions. According to a July Gallup poll , 84 percent of Americans, including 76 percent of Republicans, want a path to citizenship for the undocumented with conditions - something Trump derides as \"amnesty.\" Two-thirds of Americans, incidentally, are against Trump's wall. \nTrump's immigration speech should serve notice on anyone who still believes that he can or is willing to change for the general election. The GOP nominee for president intends to make America Great Again by terrorizing and demonizing immigrants, and by trampling on our nation's core values in the process. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

I saw the second plane hit the building and I said, 'Wow that's unbelievable.'\" advertisement \nHowever if Trump was residing in Trump Tower, which reports around the time suggest he was , he would have been a full four miles away from the attacks. \nPerhaps, Trump conflated footage he watched on television with something he viewed firsthand. Trump has admitted mistakenly interpreting news footage in the past \u2014 with regards to money being delivered to Iran \u2014 and he has infamously said he watched footage of Muslims in neighboring New Jersey celebrating that day, an assertion that has been repeatedly discredited .

I mean, you know, most people feel they know at least approximately the group of people that did this and where they are. But boy would you have to take a hard line on this. This just can't be tolerated,\" he said. \nLater, Trump volunteered that his property on 40 Wall Street \"actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest\u2014and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it's the tallest.\" \nTrump, who spent the previous night at a Marc Jacobs fashion show, had planned to promote the building of a new skyscraper on September 11th in Chicago, albeit not in person . Architect Adrian D. Smith was going to headline a press conference, alongside other Trump representatives, to announce the Trump Chicago, which would have been roughly 125 stories and 2,000 feet height, eclipsing Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Tower in Malaysia as the world's tallest building. Then Chicago based writer and editor Charles Shaw told PolitiFact in February that 9/11 \"was a dark day for Chicago architecture.\" \n\"The original design for Trump Chicago was beautiful and elegant,\" he said. \"It would have been the man's crowning achievement, of a decidedly different aesthetic than anything that previously bore his name.\" \nA relatively scaled down Trump Chicago tower was eventually built (reportedly fear of another 9/11 type attack was a motivation for reducing its size) and it currently ranks as the fourth tallest building in the U.S. and it boasts the highest residence in the world. \n\"Simply by virtue of standing there \u2014 and by being the tallest American building built since the 1974 completion of Sears (now Willis) Tower \u2014 Trump confounds those who predicted after 9/11 that iconic skyscrapers would never be built again,\" wrote Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin in 2011. \nRelated: Watch Donald Trump Refer to 9/11 as '7-Eleven' \nBesides missing out on his dream of building the world's tallest building, Trump has also said he lost \"hundreds of friends\" in the attack on the World Trade Center. \nAgain, this may be a case of hyperbole, as it is unlikely that the real estate mogul personally knew roughly one out of every 10 people who died that day. Multiple news outlets have not been able to determine if Trump actually knew anyone who passed away in the attack and his campaign hasn't disclosed any names. \n\"If he has hundreds of friends, he should be able to tell us about them,\" an unidentified Port Authority police officer told The Daily Beast in February. \"If he can tell us about the hundreds of friends he lost, who they were, what kind of person they were, I might have some respect for him.\" \nFollowing the attacks, Trump has also suggested that he helped in the massive clean-up efforts. Trump claims he helped clear rubble and search for survivors on 9/11: pic.twitter.com/G3yodnBMK2 \u2014 Angelo Carusone (@GoAngelo) April 19, 2016 \n\"Everyone who helped clear the rubble \u2014 and I was there, and I watched, and I helped a little bit \u2014 but I want to tell you: Those people were amazing,\" Trump said in an April speech in Buffalo. \"Clearing the rubble. Trying to find additional lives. You didn't know what was going to come down on all of us \u2014 and they handled it.\" \nIt's unclear whether Trump personally pitched in but he was spotted on the scene two days after the attack. He gave an interview with German television on September 13th, which curiously made no reference to Muslims cheering or the alleged incompetence of the Bush administration. \n\"Well, I have a lot of men down here right now,\" Trump told a reporter. \"We have over 100 and we have about 125 coming. So we'll have a couple of hundred people down here... We will be involved in some form in helping to reconstruct.\" \nHowever, The Smoking Gun reported last year that Trump never contributed to any 9/11 charities after the attacks, unless you count the $1,000 he gave to a \"controversial Scientology program that administered treatment to firemen who inhaled toxins while working on the World Trade Center pile.\" \nThis past April, Trump donated $100,000 to the 9/11 Memorial Museum, and his campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, has maintained that thousands of dollars in donations he's made over the last few years to the American Red Cross and the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Fund were in direct response to 9/11, in addition to a \"total of $102 million donated to hundreds of charitable foundations over a relatively short period of time.\" \nBut Associated Press has concluded that most of the $102 million figure was made up from \"land-related transactions\" and that roughly one tenth of that sum actually went to cash donations. \n\"A possible multimillion dollar beneficiary of Trump's gift: Donald Trump,\" they wrote last month. \"Easements \u2014 contractual limitations which formally devalue the land, even if they require no changes in its use or ownership \u2014 provide an avenue for federal tax write-offs.\" \nMeanwhile, throughout the 2016 campaign, Trump has been pilloried for accepting $150,000 in federal recovery funds intended for small businesses for purported damage (both physically and economically) to the Trump Building on 40 Wall Street, which was less than a mile away from the attack. \nWhile Trump did say in his Sept. 13 interview with German television that his property \"wasn't, fortunately, affected by what happened to the World Trade Center,\" he may have had a legitimate grievance on the economic front. \n\"The company received this small amount of money after qualifying, given the limited number of employees working at the property,\" Trump told The New York Times in May. \"For many months, I allowed people to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building. I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about.\" Adam Howard ", "FROM SEPT. 9: Drivers, Residents Blockade Port in Protest at Refugee 'Jungle' 2:05 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/761271875583\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nCALAIS, France \u2014 President Francois Hollande said Monday that France will shut down \"The Jungle\" migrant camp in Calais .

Can you name a famous Mexican American? \nThursday marks the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, which runs September 15 through October 15. \nThis period includes the anniversaries of independence of several Latin American countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Chile, Belize, and Costa Rica) as well as Columbus Day on October 12. \nThe U.S. Latino population is currently estimated at 55 million, and Hispanics are more visible and influential than ever before. \nYet as our video shows, misperceptions about Latinos are not uncommon. \nSo here are five takeaways for Hispanic Heritage Month 2016: 1. Latinos are the largest ethnic/racial group in the U.S. - not the fastest-growing. \nLatinos remain the country's largest ethnic/racial minority group, comprising 17 percent of the U.S. population. \nBut according to Census Bureau figures, Asians are the country's fastest-growing minority group. Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew Hispanic Center noted that, between 2000 and 2010, Latinos and Asians had roughly the same rate of growth. Since then, the U.S. Asian population has been growing faster that the U.S. Latino population. \nRELATED: Asians Remain Fastest-Growing US Group as Pacific Islanders, Mixed-Race Numbers Grow: Census \n\"Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, immigration from Latin America fueled the growth of the Hispanic population. Now this has dropped off, to the point where there are more Mexicans leaving the country than arriving ,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, the U.S.-born Hispanic population has lower fertility rates than immigrants.\" 2. The three states with the largest Latino populations are California, Texas and Florida. \nMore than half of the overall U.S. Latino population reside in these states , with California being home to about 15 million Latinos, Texas to 10 million, and Florida to 4 million. New Mexico has the largest percentage of a state population that is Latino: 48 percent. advertisement \nPew Research's Mark Hugo Lopez told NBC News that he expected these trends to continue, although the growth of the Latino population in California and Texas would likely slow in the future. \nSouthern states like Alabama and Georgia have been strong drivers of Latino population growth; about 43 percent of the growth of the national Latino population was in the southeast. In 2002, the California Voting Rights Act became the first state law that strengthened a provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that prohibits racial discrimination. Roman Knertser \nPeople might be surprised to know that the fastest-growing counties for Latinos are in North Dakota. Williams County, Stark County and Ward County, North Dakota, all saw their Hispanic populations more than double between 2007 to 2014. Lopez attributes this to North Dakota's oil boom, which has resulted in Latinos moving there to work in the oil industry and in construction. 3. Mexican-Americans comprise almost two-thirds of the U.S. Latino population. advertisement \nMexican-Americans have made their mark in politics and civil rights (HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Cesar Ch\u00e1vez), entertainment (Eva Longoria, George Lopez, Selena ), sports (Mark Sanchez, Oscar de la Hoya) and even in space ( astronaut Jos\u00e9 Hernandez ). \nSo why does the public, at times, seem to be unfamiliar with the contributions of Mexican-Americans? \nRaquel Rubio-Goldsmith of the University of Arizona's Department of Mexican American Studies theorizes that it stems from a lack of education. Mexican-American history is not taught at the elementary and high school levels, she pointed out. \"At most, the curriculums might include a mention of Cesar Chavez .\" \n\"We (Mexican-Americans) have always been like a kind of invisible people. The master narrative comes out of the East Coast, and that leaves us out,\" Rubio-Goldsmith said. \"It is only lately that our numbers are growing so that people are paying attention.\" While there has been some recent growth of Mexican-American Studies programs , she believes that \"we still have a long way to go.\" 4. Most U.S Latinos are native-born. \nDespite the widespread perception that most Latinos are immigrants - a 2012 poll found that Americans erroneously believed that 1 out of 3 Latinos were undocumented immigrants - a majority of U.S. Hispanics were born here. The Migration Policy Institute reports that only 35 percent of Latinos are immigrants. \nCynthia Pleitez of the Hispanic Heritage Foundation said it's important to see beyond outdated stereotypes and assumptions about Latinos. \n\"People should know, for example, that Latinos are very technologically savvy. We over-index for use of social media ,\" Pleitez told NBC News. \"We are people who value technology and entrepreneurship.\" Lilia Hernandez displays a USA hat during Fourth of July festivities at Legoland, California on Tuesday, July 4, 2012 in Carlsbad, California. Sandy Huffaker/Corbis / Corbis via Getty Images \n\"We are not a threat to American culture or values. We (Latinos) are actually a representation of America's core values,\" she said. \"We are a direct succession of what it means to be American. We are here in the country to be a part of it like anybody else.\" 5. A taco truck on every corner might not be a bad idea. \nIn a recent interview with MSNBC , Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump, warned that Latino culture was \"very dominant\" and that \"if you don't do something about it, you're going to have taco trucks on every corner.\" His words lit up social media, and within minutes \"TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner\" was trending on Twitter . Columnists around the world jumped on this viral hashtag , and NPR declared the phrase \"Meme of the Week.\" \nYet there may be an economic case for having taco trucks on every corner. Working from Census Bureau data to extrapolate the number of corners in the U.S., Washington Post columnist Phillip Bump estimated that a taco truck on every corner could result in at least 9.6 million new jobs. \nAnd that's only based on his estimate of three people working in each taco truck; a taco truck on every corner would have a multiplier effect on other jobs, such as mechanics, gas station workers, grocers, and farm workers. What's more \u2014 the production, distribution, and consumption of the output of these trucks would likely stay completely within the USA. \nWe'll take two tacos \"al Pastor\" to go. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .

It's worth noting that immigrants in the U.S. collectively contribute nearly $12 billion to state and local tax coffers.

He promised to cut off funding to \"sanctuary cities,\" immediately remove any undocumented immigrant arrested for a crime, and warned that \"no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.\" \nHillary Clinton, by contrast, has pledged to pursue legislation creating a path to citizenship for qualifying immigrants in her first 100 days in office. Failing that, she has pledged to \"go even further\" than President Obama in using executive action to shield undocumented immigrants from deportations, and pledged she would not deport children or break up families. \n\"I do not have the same policy as the current administration does,\" Clinton said during a Democratic debate in March. \"I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.\" \nTrump has said he would deport young undocumented immigrants without hesitation; Clinton has hired DREAMers to campaign jobs.

That effort was killed in the House by a populist uprising that presaged the party's sharp turn to the right in the 2016 presidential race. \nWith the Clinton and Trump so far off now, it's an open question whether there's hope for another bipartisan effort akin to the 2013 bill or for substantial legislation in line with Trump's enforcement-only plan. advertisement \nIf Clinton fails to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package, she would still have plenty of room to act. Obama's 2014 proposal to grant temporary work permits to several million additional undocumented immigrants has been stymied by the courts, but that's because the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 this year and deferred to a lower court's decision. If Clinton appoints a new justice who decides a similar plan is legal, it could go forward. Mexico will pay for the wall! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2016 \nTrump could face tougher challenges enacting his agenda on his own. While he has pledged to undo Obama's executive orders protecting DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants from deportation, he would need Congress to approve funding for his border wall, expand the number of officers deporting immigrants, and add new judges and detention centers to process their cases. \nCongress would also have to approve his proposal to institute a mandatory e-verify system to detect illegal workers as well as other security measures like a nationwide system to track visa overstays. Versions of these measures were included in the Gang of Eight bill, but it's unlikely Democrats would go along with them outside of a comprehensive package that included a path to legal status. \nSome pro-reform Republicans, Democrats, and activists have predicted a Trump loss would again send Republicans back to the negotiating table out of fear the issue was dragging down the national party. Polls have consistently shown Trump's no-exceptions deportation policy is a minority view even within his own party: 77 percent of voters backed a path to legal status over deportations in a Fox News poll this week and pluralities of Republican primary voters said the same in nearly every state with exit polls this year. \n\"Republican Party won't win WH until after some comprehensive immigration is passed & in rear window,\" former Romney strategist Stu Stevens tweeted on Thursday. \"It's math.\" Play ", "Sep 15 2016, 11:47 am ET Why Utah Stands Out Even in an Unpredictable Presidential Year by Adam Howard advertisement \nAs the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign approaches its last 50 days, both major parties are anxious about the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the race. \nThe most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls point to an electoral college map that is decidedly scrambled \u2014 with recently blue states like New Hampshire and Nevada trending Trump, and Clinton making inroads in reliably red states like Arizona and Georgia. \nStill, one of the most shocking examples of how this year is like no other is Utah, a state Gallup once declared the \"most Republican\" in America, that could fall in the Democratic column in November. \nFor weeks, several articles and some polls have suggested that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could have a hard time carrying the state , in part because of his apparently tempestuous relationship with the Mormon community. But Utah hasn't gone blue since Lyndon Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. \"People don't understand the Mormon thing. I do. I get it.\" advertisement \nDuring the Democratic primaries, the thousands of Utahns who turned out to see Sen. Bernie Sanders in March suggested there was an audience, or at least an open-mindedness, to Democratic agenda items. According to Tim Chambless , a University of Utah professor of Political Science at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, if the mostly young, first-time voters who overwhelmingly caucused for Sanders show their support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, it could make the difference on Election Day. \nFor his part, Trump's struggles to appeal to Utah's Mormon population highlight the potential hurdles he faces in the state and potentially beyond. \n\"People don't understand the Mormon thing. I do. I get it,\" he insisted in a 2014 New York Times interview, in which he also argued that Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election in part because Christian voters were \" put off \" by his Mormonism.

Recent estimates suggest that while their portion of the population has dropped, it remains in the 60 percent range (a whopping 2 million-plus members ), with the next largest representation, in Idaho, being a distant second with roughly 19 percent. \nMeanwhile, Nevada, which was expected to be a crucial swing state this election cycle, has a Mormon population around 4 percent , which is similar to the margin that currently separates Trump and Clinton in most state polls there. \nThe Mormon population appears to present a perfect storm of affinities that are anathema to Trump's brand: They tend to be disproportionately higher educated , a voting bloc that has resisted Trump to date. Besides their stances on abortion and same-sex marriage, they tend to be much more moderate on issues like immigration and religious tolerance. Speaking of which, Trump's oft-proposed Muslim ban is said to be eerily reminiscent of the persecution Mormons were subjected to centuries ago. And his appeals to evangelicals , who are frequently hostile towards Mormonism , haven't helped either. Mormons purportedly place a priority on the personal values of a candidate \u2014 and Trump's history of marital infidelities and tabloid drama hasn't gone over well . The Mormon community also is said to prefer more mild-manner politicians, hence their embrace of former Gov. Jon Huntsman, and so Trump's bombast has backfired with them. Trump's very personal animus directed at Romney , arguably the most prominent Mormon figure in America, has also not endeared him to the community. He has also clashed with other prominent Mormon politicians like Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). The GOP nominee has been on record as blaming Romney's faith in part for his 2012 defeat. \nTrump had one of his worst showings of the 2016 GOP primary race in Utah, finishing a distant third to Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich. And in November, he will not just be competing against Clinton, and Libertarian Gary Johnson, but independent candidate Evan McMullin , as well. (Green Party candidate Jill Stein has yet to qualify for the ballot there.) advertisement \nWhile Clinton has reached out to Mormon community with an op-ed in the Deseret News , it could be Salt Lake City's increasingly diverse, and decidedly less Mormon , population that may be the biggest benefit to her. \nThe city not only boasts an openly gay mayor and an increasingly non-white, multi-lingual population, but its economic success in the tech industry (some have already christened Utah the \"next Silicon Valley\" ) has also attracted younger, more progressive-minded voters from out of state. That group will arguably shape the political identity of the state in coming generations. \nRelated: DNC Expands Footprint in Arizona, Georgia, Utah \nThe shifting population is a trend not unlike what we've seen in several other traditionally red states around the country like Virginia and Colorado \u2014 where an influx of college-educated, left-leaning voters into more urban and suburban centers has exerted more influence in our national elections. \nMeanwhile, McMullin, who was born in Provo and is Mormon himself, is expected to over-perform in Utah , even though he has failed to gain traction nationally.

Politico first reported that Jacob Monty, Alfonso Aguilar, and Pastor Ramiro Pe\u00f1a were out on Trump, with Monty resigning from the council and Pe\u00f1a calling it a \u201cscam.\u201d Massey Villarreal and Grace Flores Hughes soon followed on Thursday. \nAguilar, who went from being a vocal opponent of Trump, to a consistent surrogate on cable news, said he and others tried to give the candidate a second chance. He said the loss of Gonzales\u2019 public support was one of the bigger losses for Trump moving forward. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a big one,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cHe has a big coalition of Christian pastors, in terms of grassroots, Mark Gonzales is big. He\u2019s the kind of person who mobilizes people.\u201d \nGonzales says he will still vote for Trump, because Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t an alternative, but he had been waiting to hear the long-awaited immigration speech to decide if he would serve on the campaign\u2019s council. \n\u201cIt was a complete disappointment,\u201d Gonzales said. \u201cWe were hoping he was going to go in a different direction than he did, but it was enforcement only measures dealing with only the bad of immigration \u2014 he completely left out the good immigrants bring to America.\u201d \nMost of all, the speech, littered with red meat that had hardline conservatives like Ann Coulter whooping it up on Twitter, lacked the compassion Trump\u2019s surprise trip to Mexico suggested was coming, Gonzales said. \n\u201cCompassion is more than just a word, man. Compassion is something you demonstrate, compassion was seen in Mexico, but there was no compassion in Arizona,\u201d he said. \nGonzales had seen this before. He remembers a speech Mitt Romney gave in 2012 suggesting that immigrants should self-deport themselves back to Mexico, when he told his wife that Romney had just lost the election. \nThe scene played out again Wednesday night. \n\u201cShe saw my face,\u201d a dejected Gonzales said, telling her, \u201cThis speech Donald Trump is giving is going to cost him the election.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Faith Green Timmons of the Bethel United Methodist Church, when Timmons told Trump not to be political and attack Clinton from the pulpit. Trump responded by saying \u201csomething was up\u201d with the \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201cshaking\u201d reverend. \nClinton\u2019s speech recalled Obama\u2019s 2014 CHCI address, also before a crucial election when immigration was front and center. \nAt the time, an embattled Obama was under siege by immigration activists angry over the delay of executive actions to shield undocumented people from deportation. \nHe challenged Latinos in the audience then not just to vote in November, but to also support post-election efforts to explain the importance of immigration. \nThis year, Clinton said she hopes to inspire a high-level of turnout from Latinos that are under 35. \u201cWe need you,\u201d she said, during a week when Democrats have fretted that young Latinos may not be excited by her candidacy. \nDuring his speech this year a relaxed Obama made jokes, reusing his line on the trail of \u201cThanks Obama\u201d because of the accomplishments during his administration. He invoked Trump without using his name, saying the country must reject the politics of \u201cbluster\u201d and \u201chigher walls\u201d and said sensible immigration changes can be made that honor that the U.S. is a country of immigrants but also of laws. \nImmigrants, he said, arrive \u201cnot as criminals, not as rapists, but as families who came here for the same reasons all families came here for,\u201d in another reference to Trump. \nClinton, who was protested by activists over accepting private prison donations, while presenting an award to chef Jose Andres at CHCI in 2015, saw no such opposition this year from the supportive crowd. She reiterated her support for immigration legislation in her first 100 days if elected and said other people with sympathetic cases should be able to make their case for deferred action as well. \nBeneficiaries should include those who have experienced and report extreme labor abuses, Clinton said, and stressed her plan to \u201cend family detention, close private detention facilities, and stop the raids and round ups.\u201d \nBut in a nod to the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month, Clinton also mentioned Latinos that have contributed to the country to cheers \u2014 those in history books like Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta and Roberto Clemente, as well as more recent notable Latinos like So\u00f1ia Sotomayor, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Laurie Hernandez.

Kumar acknowledged that it was an issue but looked forward to the work in front of Latino groups like hers that hope to bring young voters back into the fold. \n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a discussion along those lines, but it has been challenging \u2014 she\u2019s helping people register to vote now,\u201d she said of Dawson, before addressing charges of a rigged system. \u201cWhen people say the system is against us, people are doing two things: discouraging you from voting and then getting up on Nov. 8 to vote.\u201d \nKumar detailed the vast reach of voter registration efforts as Voto Latino in conjunction with groups like Mi Familia Vota, launches a month of action that looks to blow 2015 efforts out of the water. \n\u201cLast year we had 130 organizations, which registered 10,000 voters,\u201d Kumar said. \u201cThis year we have 300 organizations to date and the goal is to get 500,\u201d she said of a coalition that includes Spotify, Twitter, and AirBnB as well as celebrities like Dawson and George Lopez and the Latino secretary of states in California, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and New York. \nVoto Latino will also undertake an effort to have 24 celebrities and \u201cchangemakers\u201d in Puerto Rico calling Orlando voters, with a deluge of Puerto Ricans who have high voter participation rates from the island rapidly moving into the city. \nEveryone, from the Clinton campaign to immigration advocacy groups and the Democratic Party, has leaned into a message that Donald Trump has put forth racist and xenophobic rhetoric and policies levied against Mexicans and immigrants since the day he launched his campaign. Democrats also fear that message isn\u2019t enough from the campaign to get young Hispanics to vote. \nThey point to polls showing the Latinos most prone to dislike her are 18 to 35, with her unfavorables highest among that group and worry that she is lagging Obama\u2019s Hispanic support as the stretch run begins despite running against what they see as the most hostile presidential candidate to Latinos ever. \nA Univision/ Washington Post released Tuesday found Clinton behind Obama\u2019s 2012 showing in four key battleground states of Colorado (-13), Florida (-7), Nevada (-6) and Arizona (-6). \nThe poll found that close to half of Latinos polled in Florida (46%) and Nevada (49%), two states where the race is tight, said Clinton is a liar. \n\u201cDo you think she\u2019s a liar, it\u2019s split half say yes, half say no,\u201d one concerned Democrat said. \u201cHow is that helping the enthusiasm gap?\u201d \nSylvia Manzano, a lead pollster at Latino Decisions, which saw its two principles join the Clinton campaign as consultants last year, said while their poll last week showed that 51% of Latinos are more enthusiastic to vote now than they were in 2012, 76% said it was more important to do so. \n\u201cI suspect people may not be feeling enthusiastic because of the [Trump] attacks,\u201d Manzano said. \u201cBut is it important? 76% say this election is really important, that\u2019s worth paying attention to.\u201d Manzano said enthusiasm has a positive connotation, so while the enthusiasm of voters under 40 is low, 80% said it was more important to vote in November. \nThe large-scale repudiation of Trump by Hispanics, means the support is there for Clinton, but the turnout is key. A Latino Decisions national poll last week found her up with18-to-39-year-old voters, 68% to 18%. \nClinton will kickoff the key stretch for voter registration, which includes Hispanic Heritage Month (HHM), in a speech to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute on Thursday and the campaign is launching \u201cFe en Nuestro Voto,\u201d a national voter registration program aimed at the faith community from Sept. 19 to Sept. 25. \nThe campaign\u2019s HHM efforts will largely be concentrated in battleground states, where the Florida team will be hosting voter registration efforts at eight different Latino festivals, including in Orlando, Tampa, and Miami. There will be registration efforts in North Carolina as part of the recently launched faith and small business programs aimed at Hispanics, a tacos and beer night in Nevada for young Hispanics, and salsa lessons followed by phone banking in Colorado. \nIn fact, Colorado is a good example of the campaign\u2019s efforts to reach young Hispanics. Sandwiched around those salsa lessons, Lorella Praeli, the Latino vote director, will take part in a Facebook Live video featuring young Hispanics to discuss college affordability, one of Bernie Sanders\u2019 pet issues, and the campaign will host a \u201cGet Out the Taco Truck and Vote\u201d registration effort with Rep. Ed Perlmutter, after a Trump surrogate warned of the imminent danger of delicious taco trucks on every corner should Clinton win. \nThere is also a unique effort, powered by a popular Mexican rock band that has called Trump a racist, hitting swing states with large Latino populations. Man\u00e1\u2019s \u201cLatino Power Tour\u201d will make a dozen stops in the midst of ramped up Hispanic registration efforts and has partnered with Voto Latino to register concert-goers at its shows in cities like Phoenix, Denver, Las Vegas, and Miami. \n\u201cWe are suggesting and bringing awareness to the Latin community to use their power during the voting process as they are key in the next elections,\u201d said Man\u00e1 frontman Fher Olvera in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \u201cToday Latinos can rewrite the history of the United States.\u201d \nStill, Latino groups worry that the Hispanic vote was talked up by Democrats but commensurate resources were not allocated to them. Antonio Gonzalez, a 30-year veteran of Latino vote efforts who now runs the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project said last cycle Obama\u2019s team did a lot of voter registration themselves, but this time around Clinton\u2019s team didn\u2019t put a similar focus into registration. \n\u201cHillary and her donor class were worried about Bernie, they figured we have Trump so the Mexicans will register themselves,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThe Latino vote didn\u2019t grow, donors didn\u2019t do it, groups didn\u2019t do it. Groups like us, you can\u2019t run a car without gas.\u201d \nNCLR president Janet Murguia, who once drew Obama\u2019s ire by calling him the deporter-in-chief, said that while NCLR\u2019s voter registration funding dropped from $7 million in 2012 to $1.5 million now, her organization zeroed in on the importance of registering young Hispanic voters in partnership with mit\u00fa and a voter registration app, as well as a high school senior registration curriculum. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very reasonable to be concerned about our young cohort of millennials, particularly some who perhaps were Bernie supporters,\u201d she said. Pointing to the Obama years, she added, \u201cremember some of the younger millennials were disillusioned because some promises were made and not fulfilled and they want to know what is going to be different.\u201d \nMany doing the work around the country hope the stakes of the election will ultimately be so high that they lead young Hispanics to the polls. \n\u201cI usually love this game of trying to get people to participate,\u201d Voto Latino\u2019s Kumar said. \u201cBut speaking to moms who are saying their kids come home crying because they hear in school they will get deported \u2014 but they\u2019re born in America \u2014 how are we going to heal after this?\u201d \nHUD Secretary Julian Castro, a top Clinton Latino surrogate who was on her shortlist for vice president, said in the end Trump\u2019s toxic rhetoric will bring young Latinos to Clinton. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard out there as much of a groundswell to vote in the Latino community as I\u2019ve heard this cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the vast majority of Bernie voters, including Latinos who supported Bernie, are going to come out for Hillary in November, because of their front row seat to how bigoted Trump and his campaign has been.\u201d \nWhich is part of the rub. Many Democrats privately worry that Clinton needs to have more of a positive message for why Hispanics should support her, but ultimately many believe Trump will be enough. \nIn its poll of 3,729 registered Latino voters, Manzano of Latino Decisions said that in looking at why 80% of voters under 40 said they felt it was important to vote in this election, she noticed a key motivating factor. \nOnly 23% said they were voting to support Clinton \u2014 51% said they were doing it to stop Trump.

So far, those attempts appear to have been fruitless, BuzzFeed News has been told by UK and EU sources. \nAsked for a comment, Number 10 told BuzzFeed News that it would not be providing a running commentary on the negotiations. \nDetail of Britain\u2019s early negotiation manoeuvres have emerged ahead of a meeting of the other 27 remaining governments in Bratislava on Friday \u2013 a meeting to which the UK has not been invited. \nThe substance of future relations with Britain will not be top of the agenda. EU officials believe there will not be much to discuss until the UK triggers Article 50, and hope to focus most of this week\u2019s discussions elsewhere, on issues such as trade deals and security. \nOfficials are keen to play down expectations ahead of Friday\u2019s meeting. It will be only the second time the 27 leaders have met since the UK referendum. The informal summit is seen as the first real opportunity for the 27 to take stock of Brexit and brainstorm the EU\u2019s post-Brexit future. \nBratislava is the initial step of a process that will continue into next year with meetings scheduled in Malta and Italy. \nOfficially, the primary goal of the Bratislava meeting will be to set forth a road map for the EU\u2019s future. Major announcements are expected to be made only after this exercise ends in Rome next March, when EU leaders will gather to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the EU\u2019s founding agreement. \nBut the priority will be to put on a show of unity. \nIn the wake of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, Europe\u2019s heads of government and state all lined up to say that full access to the single market was dependent on accepting freedom of movement. \nSince then, despite some differences over how hard Brexit should be, officials have been firm that this specific condition will remain a red line in future negotiations. Interviewed by an Irish radio station on Monday, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny said the issue had been \u201cvery directly addressed\u201d with the British government. Britain\u2019s prime minister Theresa May and Irish taoiseach Enda Kenny hold a joint news conference. Pool New / Reuters ID: 9614212 \nFor some countries, freedom of movement takes on an emotional and historical note. Speaking to BuzzFeed News in Budapest last week, a senior government official close to Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban described freedom of movement as the \u201cfreedom to leave a country and live freely\u201d. \n\u201cIt is the most important achievement of post-war Europe alongside European integration,\u201d the official said. \n\u201cPolitically, we have to defend this right, and the four freedoms (of movement of goods, services, people, and capital).\u201d \nFreedom of movement is seen as one of the few direct benefits of EU membership that voters understand, the official added. All this, they said, has been made clear to senior British officials in meetings since the referendum: \u201cWhen we met, I told them that at the end of these negotiations, you cannot come out as winners in the eyes of ordinary people. There must be a price to pay.\u201d \nBut a strong attachment to free movement is not a feature exclusive to more recent member states. Days after the UK referendum, a British official described the way German chancellor Angela Merkel talked about the principle with former UK prime minister David Cameron as \u201calmost evangelical\u201d. \nOne area where Europe\u2019s more hawkish governments have softened their stance in recent weeks, though, is on the timing of the UK invoking Article 50 , the formal procedure to exit the EU. \nFollowing meetings with Theresa May, EU officials suggest that most governments have accepted that the UK needs time to figure out what Brexit means, and are resigned to the fact that the mechanism will not be triggered before the end of the year. \nA eurozone government official told BuzzFeed News that in meetings their UK counterparts have been \u201ccandid\u201d in making clear that they are absolutely not ready yet and need some time to define the direction the UK will want to go. \nThe expectation among governments BuzzFeed News has spoken to is that the UK will invoke Article 50 between January and February 2017. The belief in Europe\u2019s major capitals is that economic uncertainty and increasing pressure from Leave politicians and voters will give the government no choice but to begin withdrawal procedures within an acceptable timeframe. Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, German chancellor Angela Merkel, and French president Francois Hollande arrive for a press conference on aircraft carrier Garibaldi off the coast of Ventotene island in August. Reuters ID: 9605206 \nAhead of Friday\u2019s meeting, the 27 member states broadly agree on what are the most important challenges facing the European Union: the refugee crisis, security threats, and winning back voters\u2019 trust. \nUncontrolled irregular migration, terrorism and fear of globalisation are three main challenges for Europe \u2014 Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) ID: 9598648 \nHowever, on many aspects of these themes the EU is beset by divisions \u2013 nowhere more so than in how to deal with the refugee crisis, and how to handle migration from outside the European Union. \nAlthough there is agreement on the need to secure Europe\u2019s external borders in order to avoid the \u201cchaos\u201d of last year, for some member states the debate about refugees and non-EU migration is not just about numbers. \n\u201cThere is also an issue of provenance,\u201d the senior Hungarian official told BuzzFeed News. Assuming arrivals were controlled, and procedures were respected, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have an issue with refugees from Ukraine,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe problem here is also cultural, demographic, and religious.\u201d \n\u201cSome Muslims do not respect the European way of life,\u201d they added. \nThe official alleges that there are areas in European cities, including Paris and Copenhagen, that are dangerous because many North African migrants have not integrated, live in isolation, and polarise communities. \nOn Tuesday, Luxembourg\u2019s foreign minister told a German newspaper that Hungary should be kicked out of the EU for treating refugees worse than \u201cwild animals\u201d, and allegedly violating fundamental EU principles. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban Laszlo Balogh / Reuters ID: 9605397 \nAlthough the tone may be different, central Europe isn\u2019t the only place where European identity is a sensitive issue. It is set to take centre stage in next year\u2019s French and German elections. A heated debate about multiculturalism is already taking place in both countries, setting dividing lines between presidential candidates in France and within political parties in Germany, where chancellor Merkel has been weakened by a string of poor state election results following her refusal to back down on her welcoming stance towards refugees. \nFor the governments of central Europe, the refugee crisis and attempts to force migrant quotas on member states are also a proxy of what they believe is an overreaching European Commission \u2013 and Brexit presents an opportunity to revisit the balance of powers between EU institutions and member states. \nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News at the beginning of September, Poland\u2019s deputy prime minister spoke of the need to bridge a democratic divide between institutions and member states. Mateusz Morawiecki also said member states shouldn\u2019t be overshadowed by EU institutions. \nHungarian officials are more direct: \u201cEuropean Commission president Juncker and European Parliament president Schulz are not doing their job.\u201d \n\u201cThe commission misinterprets its role. It should be the guardian of EU treaties, and should not be allowed to overwrite what member states decide,\u201d the senior official said. \nThey also accuse the commission of double standards, recalling how in 2010 the former commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso refused to grant Hungary the same fiscal flexibility now being offered to other member states. \u201cThis makes our membership look second-class,\u201d the official claimed. \nBoth the Polish and Hungarian governments, which have pledged to wage a \u201ccultural counter-revolution\u201d to reform Europe post-Brexit, worry that the EU\u2019s core and founding member states will decide Europe\u2019s future among themselves. \nIn Bratislava, leaders will want to stay away from discussions about the commission\u2019s powers. \u201cThe 27 will not go there,\u201d a senior official told BuzzFeed News. Most member states, including Germany, are in no mood to open lengthy treaty renegotiations. \nAt the same time, though, capitals do not want to see this as an excuse for Brussels to grab more powers. In a letter sent by Donald Tusk to the 27 leaders on Tuesday, the president of the European Council noted that a conclusion he has drawn from consulting member states over the past few weeks was that \u201cthe institutions should support the priorities as agreed among member states, and not impose their own ones\u201d. \nHowever, the ongoing turf war between the commission and member states is unlikely to go away soon. In a document seen by BuzzFeed News, European Commission officials describe Tusk and Merkel\u2019s shuttle diplomacy, and the past months\u2019 meetings between groups of EU leaders and ones between blocs of countries and Socialist party leaders, as serving as \u201cmegaphones for national agendas\u201d with member states offering little in terms of alternatives to commission proposals. \nDivisions between governments also remain on how to enable greater competitiveness across the continent, between those that would like to embrace more expansionary policies and those that see fiscal discipline as the guiding light. \nStill, on other issues, such as greater cooperation on defence (aspects of which would have previously been blocked by the UK), strengthening external border controls, working towards closer security relations (possibly including a US-style visa system ), and supporting measures to boost youth employment , the differences between member states are narrower \u2013 and are more likely to be bridged in the months to come. \nIn his letter to the 27 leaders, Tusk says that on the one hand, the EU should establish the best possible relations with the UK, but on the other hand, should be \u201ccoolheaded, consistent, and fully united as well as firm in insisting on a balance of rights and obligations\u201d. \n\u201cIf we do so, there will be no room for doubt that it is a good thing to be a member of the Union\u201d. ", "Justin Sullivan / Getty Images ID: 9669580 \nLast summer, when Donald Trump began his rise to the nomination, Hillary Clinton responded by pointing a finger squarely and firmly at the Republican Party. \nTrump might sound extreme, she said , \u201cbut if you look at everyone else\u2019s policies, they\u2019re pretty much the same.\u201d He might make \u201chateful comments,\u201d she said, \u201cbut how many others disagree with him?\u201d \nLater that year, when Trump proposed his ban on Muslims, Clinton responded again by implicating the rest of the Republican Party. \u201cTheir language may be more veiled than Trump\u2019s,\u201d she said , \u201cbut their ideas are not so different.\u201d \nAnd the following spring, when Trump solidified his lead in the primary, Clinton yet again faulted the modern Republican Party. \u201cDonald Trump didn\u2019t come out of nowhere,\u201d she said . \u201cWhat the Republicans have sown with their extremist tactics, they are now reaping with [his] candidacy.\u201d \nSo when Trump secured the nomination just a few weeks later in May, officials at the Democratic Party expected to hear more of the same from their own candidate, turning the new GOP standard-bearer into a sweeping indictment of the Republican Party, the Republican platform, and every Republican running for House and Senate. \nWhat Clinton did instead was vastly different. \nThat month, the candidate and her team of aides in Brooklyn set out on a new approach, outlined for the Democratic National Committee in an internal email that landed in the communications shop as something of a shock. \u201cThey want to make Trump look even more extreme than the rank-and-file Republican member of Congress,\u201d the DNC\u2019s deputy communications director wrote on the night of May 13, summarizing a conversation earlier that evening with Clinton\u2019s rapid response director, Zac Petkanas. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to link the House and Senate Republicans to Trump,\u201d the message read. \nThe bottom line? \n\u201cThe campaign does not want to connect Trump and the Republican Party.\u201d \nThe email, made public along with 20,000 others on WikiLeaks as part of a massive cyberattack on the DNC this summer, is one of about two dozen exchanges that reveal a running tension this spring over the campaign\u2019s decision to \u201c disaggregate \u201d Trump from the Republican Party. The strategic shift made back in May didn\u2019t just drive a wedge between Clinton\u2019s team and the officials tasked with coordinating the party across the states. It fundamentally upended the way Democrats talk about Republicans. \n\u201cI think that\u2019s crazy\u201d was the reply from the DNC\u2019s communications director, Luis Miranda, whose emails make up more than half of those on WikiLeaks. (Miranda and other top officials at the DNC, including the chair, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, later stepped down in the wake of the hack.) \u201cInsane,\u201d he wrote again a few hours later, concerned that campaign\u2019s approach might let down-ballot Republicans off the hook. \nMonths later, Clinton\u2019s strategy is unrecognizable from the first year of her campaign. She doesn\u2019t tie Trump to the rest of the Republican Party. She doesn\u2019t talk about Republican extremism or Republican rhetoric or Republican ideology. She has made the race almost exclusively about Donald Trump, his temperament, his qualifications, his character, and his fitness to serve, leaving the rest of the Democratic Party to adjust to a general election that has little to do with traditional partisan policy or politics. \nThe result, with less than 50 days until Election Day, is a Democratic nominee who praises establishment Republicans, makes forceful appeals for bipartisan support, and only rarely addresses Trump as President Obama might have John McCain or Mitt Romney in 2008 or 2012, strictly avoiding attacks on Republicans writ large. \nIt\u2019s a message that requires great discipline from a candidate who once made a starkly different case, appearing at times to delight in attacking Republican policy. (At one rally in Rhode Island before the end of the primary, Clinton memorably nodded along in approval when the crowd booed one of her lines stating that Trump and his competitor Ted Cruz were peddling \u201c the same snake oil \u201d as the rest of Republicans.) \nWhen she recently deviated from her general election approach, describing \u201c half \u201d of Trump\u2019s supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d\u2014 a remark that cast millions of Republicans as racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic \u2014 Clinton quickly apologized for the broad characterization. \u201cI regret saying \u2018half,\u2019\u201d she said. (The retraction notably did nothing to back away from what she again described as Trump\u2019s \u201cdeplorable\u201d behavior.) \nOn the trail, Clinton doesn\u2019t engage much in the economic and social debates that typically animate both parties in a presidential election. (In May, on at least two occasions, WikiLeaks emails show, Clinton\u2019s team asked the DNC to stay \u201cout of policy\u201d when it came to framing Trump \u2014 once around his May 12 meeting with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and a second time in relation to infrastructure messaging.) \nClinton\u2019s stump speech from the primary \u2014 a laundry list of policy proposals, capped off with a reminder that \u201c everything I\u2019ve just said, the Republicans disagree with \u201d\u2014 gave way this summer to highly specific and often personal portraits of Trump, his record, and his credentials. A stray comment last month to a crowd in St. Petersburg, Fla. \u2014 that Trump\u2019s tax plan would \u201c repackage trickle-down economics \u201d\u2014 is perhaps the closest she\u2019s come since the spring to identifying Trump with mainstream GOP policy. \nInstead, as Clinton presents it now, this election is about \u201cvalues.\u201d (\u201c Consider our plans and the values behind them ,\u201d the candidate tells voters.) And she means values in the most basic sense of the word \u2014 touchstones of decency and fairness that, against Trump, have suddenly become (big-D) Democratic slogans. Her speeches cast the GOP nominee as a threat to \u201c big-heartedness ,\u201d\u201c tolerance \u201d\u2014 the belief that \u201c no one\u2019s worthless, no one\u2019s less-than .\u201d Her tagline on the trail is the simple idea that \u201c love trumps hate .\u201d Her running mate describes the race as \u201c near existential \u201d\u2014 a choice about \u201c fidelity to our values .\u201d And her field offices across the country are decorated more often with words like \u201ckindness\u201d than anything overtly partisan. (Next to \u201cHillary For President\u201d and \u201cYaaas Hillary\u201d posters on the wall in Nashua, N.H., one sign simply reads, \u201cBe Respectful.\u201d) \nEarlier this month, delivering a speech about the hallmark Republican theme of American exceptionalism, Clinton admitted that such topics should normally be \u201c above politics .\u201d But, she told the crowd at the American Legion, \u201cthis is not a normal election.\u201d \n\u201cThe debates are not the normal disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.\u201d \nThrough the month of May, the party\u2019s adjustment to Clinton\u2019s new normal did not come quickly, easily, or without some resistance inside the Democratic apparatus in Washington tasked with races at the state and local levels, and presented with the opportunity of a historically unpopular Republican nominee. The internal DNC emails on WikiLeaks offer an unvarnished glimpse at a campaign and party operation out of sync at times on messaging objectives that in any other election year might be routine. \nIn one early instance, the hacked emails show, both offices separately drew up plans for the highly anticipated May 12 Paul Ryan-Donald Trump summit on Capitol Hill. The day of the meeting, Miranda, the DNC communications director, and Petkanas, the Clinton rapid response director, discovered that they had prepared contradictory talking points. \nTo Clinton, the meeting with Ryan, an occasional Trump critic, showcased the distance between establishment Republicans and an alienating nominee. The DNC, meanwhile, had already instructed the Democratic state parties to say the opposite: that Ryan may not like Trump, but they share \u201cthe same divisive agenda\u201d and \u201csame old Republican playbook.\u201d (They even designed posters: \u201cReject the Trump-Ryan Agenda.\u201d) \n\u201cThis is unfortunate messaging,\u201d Petkanas wrote to Miranda, forwarding one of the state party press releases highlighting Trump and Ryan\u2019s shared policy positions. \nMiranda, at this point, had yet to receive the email about decoupling Trump from the GOP. (That came a day later.) He replied , asking for \u201cbetter clarity,\u201d then added flatly: \u201cBecause the idea that we would prop up Paul Ryan as a model isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d \nPetkanas wrote back , frustrated. He referenced a call from the day before \u2014\u201ca whole back and forth on this exact subject\u201d\u2014 where, he said, they had \u201cspecifically talked about how we don\u2019t want to tie them together just yet or talk about the Ryan-Trump agenda.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s what you agreed to do on the 1:30 p.m. call yesterday. That\u2019s what I informed our campaign that you would be doing,\u201d Petkanas said , prompting no further reply. \nThrough the end of May, the plan to \u201cdisaggregate\u201d Trump, as it was described in one lengthy email , remained a source of frustration for Miranda, the campaign\u2019s go-between on messaging at the DNC. In the same message, subject-lined \u201cProblem with HFA [Hillary For America],\u201d he argued that the campaign\u2019s frame \u2014 that \u201cTrump is much worse than regular Republicans\u201d\u2014 would give down-ballot GOP candidates an \u201ceasy out\u201d and put every Democrat not named Clinton at a possible disadvantage. (\u201cIt might be a good strategy ONLY for Clinton,\u201d Miranda wrote.) Worse, he added, the strategy would put the party \u201cat odds\u201d with the its own broader message against Republicanism. \nAs Miranda put it to one colleague , Democrats had been building the case for years against an increasingly extreme GOP, drawing a line from the rise of hardline Tea Party figures to the fights over affirmative action, immigration, and same-sex marriage of the early- and mid-2000s, to as far back as Richard Nixon\u2019s so-called Southern Strategy in the 1960s, Miranda said. His point was the same one Clinton used to make before the end of the primaries: that Republicans \u201cmade their bed and now they\u2019re lying in it,\u201d as Miranda said in the email. \u201cDemocrats couldn\u2019t dump the approach,\u201d he wrote , citing congressional leaders like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi who had been making the case he had in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than turning an aircraft carrier. We would lose 3/4 of the fleet.\u201d \nReached Thursday, Miranda declined to comment on the emails or Clinton\u2019s strategy. \nSince May, Democratic officials working on races up and down the ticket said in recent interviews, any initial hurdles have been overcome inside the party: Clinton, they said, can hold up Republicans who have rejected Trump, while House and Senate Democrats put the pressure on those who haven\u2019t, including such candidates in closely watched races as Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Rep. Barbara Comstock in Virginia. \nBut the messaging marks a subtle but significant shift for down-ballot Democrats, many of whom used to blast out releases about \u201cthe party of Trump,\u201d casting the Republicans as a reflection of the same GOP that produced Trump. In the general election, Democrats now ask why Republicans haven\u2019t backed away from him altogether, arguing that candidates have chosen \u201cparty over country\u201d\u2014 a message that better fits the Clinton framework, distancing Trump from the rest of the Republicans up for election. \nThe strategies are distinct, said one Democratic operative working on 2016 races, but \u201cnot contradictory.\u201d Since May, a second Democratic operative said, the party has developed an understanding that \u201cdifferent entities can do different things.\u201d \nStill, the message has disadvantages for Democrats. \nSenate Republicans have been able to distance themselves from Trump to their benefit: In New Hampshire, 78% of voters see Ayotte, a first-term senator who rarely mentions her party\u2019s nominee on the campaign trail, as a \u201c different kind of Republican \u201d than Trump, according to a CBS News-YouGov poll of battleground states last month. \nTwo other vulnerable GOP incumbent candidates, Sens. Pat Toomey and Richard Burr, have seen a similar dynamic among voters in their respective home states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. In Ohio, 20% of likely Clinton voters said in another recent poll that they will also vote for incumbent Republican Sen. Rob Portman over the Democrat. \nAnd despite Clinton\u2019s lengthy list of policy proposals (clocking in at 113,000 words on the campaign\u2019s website), her message has become closely associated with an anti-Trump position. \nThis month, even as her aides have promised that Clinton will make a more \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201caspirational\u201d case on the trail, as communications director Jennifer Palmieri put it to reporters last week, Clinton still spends much of her time drawing contrasts. The candidate\u2019s new \u201cStronger Together\u201d speeches \u2014 an ongoing series unveiled by Palmieri as an effort to highlight \u201cthe values that motivate\u201d Clinton and move \u201cbeyond just Donald Trump\u201d\u2014 still name or invoke the GOP nominee, and in some cases do so at length. \nThe strategy is one the candidate and her aides committed to back in May, and still continue to drive daily on the trail and from headquarters. If one theme runs through many of this spring\u2019s hacked DNC emails relating to message, it is that the Clinton campaign has shaped the party\u2019s approach in matters large and small , dictating broad changes, slight tweaks, setting the course for Democrats in the general election. \nTrump\u2019s foreign policy views? \u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s on over his head,\u201d Petkanas told DNC officials in late April. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s advocating for some very dangerous policies that undermine our national interest and our security.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s business record? \u201cWe have found that calling him a failed businessman is ineffective,\u201d deputy communications director Christina Reynolds wrote in May. \u201cAiming more at the angle that he got rich at the expense of the little guy, etc., is much more believable and effective.\u201d \nAnd Trump, period? When party officials started referring to him as \u201cDangerous Donald,\u201d Clinton\u2019s team quickly vetoed the idea. \u201cWe are very worried that Dangerous Donald sounds too much like him \u2014 it\u2019s Lyin\u2019 Ted or Corrupt Hillary,\u201d Reynolds wrote in a message to the communications team, \u201cwhich undermines the broader point.\u201d \nAfter the fact, emails show, DNC officials still disagreed with the decision.

He said a Labour government would go a step further and stop British arms exports earlier, whenever there are \u201ccredible reports\u201d of war crimes. \nHis intervention came during a speech in which he received a standing ovation for apologising for Labour\u2019s role in the invasion of Iraq and said the current refugee crisis was \u201cfuelled by wars across the Middle East\u201d that have been exacerbated by \u201crepeated military interventions by British governments\u201d. \nSome Labour MPs raised concerns that restricting arms sales would hit jobs in the British arms industry, although a spokesperson for the Labour leader told BuzzFeed News trade unions had been consulted on the issue and that Labour was simply committing to enforcing the existing rules. \n\u201cThat\u2019s always been an issue in relation to arms sales,\u201d they said. \u201cA lot of jobs depend on the arms industry. In a way our position is not different from that of the British government in principle. The difference is over the interpretation of the existing evidence.\u201d \nThe spokesperson said the arms sale ban would apply to any country where there is \u201cclear evidence of war crimes\u201d.

Pastor Ramiro Pe\u00f1a told Politico he would have to reconsider being part of a \u201cscam.\u201d \nAnd others, like leading Hispanic conservatives Alfonso Aguilar and Pastor Mark Gonzales \u2014 who counts thousands of Latino evangelical churches as part of his groups \u2014 made a clean break, informing the RNC that they would not be publicly endorsing Trump or helping the council. \nRNC officials have disputed how many members left the council in conversations with Hispanic Republicans, and told BuzzFeed news only two official members left. Some, like Aguilar, were never officially part of the group, though he like the rest submitted ideas to the campaign on the ways undocumented immigrants could remain in the country, an idea Trump seemed intrigued by at the Aug. 20 council meeting. \nThe RNC has also admonished those who left over immigration, with the message that Trump never promised them anything. Latino conservatives say RNC officials have worked in the last week to replenish the council with new members, which the RNC confirmed, though other departures may still occur. \nThe RNC told BuzzFeed News that despite departures it has received \u201cconsiderable\u201d support from other Hispanic leaders nationwide who wish to participate on the council and in other state initiatives. \u201cAs a result, we are welcoming new members to the National Advisory Council for Trump,\u201d RNC Hispanic media director Helen Aguirre-Ferre said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, we have the commitment from many others who wish to participate in various initiatives, particularly in battleground states.\u201d \nBut those close to the council, former members, and former RNC staffers say that one thing is for sure: The days of the group having any measure of influence with the campaign are done. \n\u201cOh, gosh, no, they won\u2019t meet again,\u201d said Leslie Sanchez, a veteran Republican strategist close to some of the council members, asked if she anticipated the group sitting with Trump and campaign officials again before the election, but stressed it was just her opinion. \n\u201cAfter that speech, how real is that council?\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cEven if they meet what are they going to say, what are they going to talk about? It has no power or influence, at least to the campaign.\u201d \nArtemio Muniz, a Texas Republican leader close to many on the council was succinct: \u201cIt\u2019s never going to meet again, these are people with no influence.\u201d \nLatino Republicans say the group was intended to be like similar ones for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, with the RNC playing a major role. In the past, those lists have featured 200 people; Trump\u2019s version began with only 23 members, and half were relatively new to an advisory role or have less influence nationally. By comparison, Jeb Bush unveiled a 228-member Hispanic leadership committee during the primary. \nSome like Jacob Monty, who has since left Trump\u2019s council, connected with the campaign after he stuck his neck out with a June op-ed in the Houston Chronicle titled \u201cA Latino\u2019s Case For Donald Trump.\u201d Others were in touch with the RNC as preparations for the convention ramped up. Aguilar said the genesis, though, was at the convention. He said that Aguirre-Ferre viewed the council as a vehicle to start Trump\u2019s Latino outreach in earnest. \nThe group met first on Aug. 19, a day before their ill-fated session with Trump turned into a weekend of confusing coverage . The RNC\u2019s Jenny Korn attended the Aug. 19 meeting, along with the campaign\u2019s coalitions director Alan Cobb. At the meeting, the Hispanic advisers were honest about their concerns with Trump. A day later, though, the RNC sent out a memo with the names of the council members, which suggested the group was working on behalf of the campaign. \nDuring the Aug. 20 meeting, council members perceived Trump as willing to shift his position on mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, an opinion multiple members related to reporters. After the ensuing firestorm \u2014 Trump has staked his candidacy on tough immigration policies \u2014 the campaign criticized the RNC. In a story about tensions between the campaign and the committee, the New York Times reported that Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller wrote in an email, \u201cThe RNC needs to take control of this situation and quickly.\u201d \nBut Trump leaning on the RNC for Hispanic outreach was deliberate, Aguilar said, recalling that the Trump campaign\u2019s Cobb told him, \u201cI have so much to do I\u2019m going to have to defer to the RNC\u201d on Latino engagement. \nOr as a former RNC staffer put it, the campaign didn\u2019t even have the skeleton operation for Hispanic issues that it had for black outreach led by Omarosa Manigault. \n\u201cTrump has no organization for Hispanic stuff,\u201d the operative said, before adding dismissively, \u201cThey don\u2019t have an Omarosa \u2014 none of the famous Hispanics that were on The Apprentice have stepped up to serve.\u201d \nAs has been reported, Trump\u2019s Hispanic supporters said they were misled, and even those who did not resign felt that the candidate was pivoting to become the softer edge, deal-making businessman they saw during his trip to Mexico. \nBut when the Times reported that Miller had also called those who resigned \u201cprofessional amnesty lobbyists,\u201d he did more than anger those who had stopped supporting Trump. \nMonty, a Houston-based immigration lawyer, was livid about Miller\u2019s comment. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to challenge that little punk to see who has donated more to Republican candidates me or him,\u201d Monty said. \u201cI didn\u2019t wake up and decide I was a Republican, I\u2019ve been doing this since 1997. Raising money, this is my life. I\u2019m more of a Republican than him or (Sen. Jeff Sessions).\u201d Miller formerly worked for Sessions and former Rep. Michele Bachmann. \nMonty added that he is telling Texas Republican friends of his not to waste their money on the top of the ticket and instead create a down ballot speed bump for Hillary Clinton, who he does not support, in case she wins. \nMiller\u2019s words contributed to a feeling from some council members that the campaign doesn\u2019t want them, putting them in a more difficult position because many are already feeling immense pressure for supporting Trump in the first place. \nEddie Aldrete, a council member, has told friends he is considering leaving the group, but finds himself in a tough position because he works for the Latino-owned IBC Bank, whose CEO, Dennis Nixon, is the Texas state finance chair for Trump. \nNixon\u2019s IBC bank, which does lots of business with the Hispanic community on both sides of the border, features a logo with a map of the U.S. and Mexico. The bank drew the ire of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus\u2019 Bold PAC, which voted to spend $50,000 to inform Hispanics of Nixon\u2019s Trump support. The bank is also feeling pressure from Mexican clients angry over its leadership supporting Trump, a source said. \nIBC Bank did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication. \nMario Rodriguez \u2014 an influential council member and chairman of the Hispanic 100, a PAC working to get more Hispanics to vote for Republicans \u2014 has told friends he was throwing up listening to Trump\u2019s immigration speech, and had to put out a fire with a major client over his Trump support. \nBut Rodriguez, like others who doesn\u2019t love Trump, has privately said he isn\u2019t convinced Trump will lose and doesn\u2019t want to leave the council because he would rather have a seat at the table than not. \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce members also criticized Massey Villarreal, a Texas-based member of the council, before he resigned. The group\u2019s president, Javier Palomarez, who last week called Trump a \u201cclown\u201d on MSNBC for his immigration speech, confirmed that he fielded those complaints, but like Villarreal, he too privately met with Trump last Fall and felt betrayed by what he saw as the contrast between the public Trump and the private Trump. \n\u201cI met with Donald and in a private setting he was quiet, respectful, mannerly and inquisitive, Palomarez said. \u201cLike I had been shocked by his double down on immigration, Massey went through what I went through.\u201d \nAnother advisory council member from Texas, Henry Bonilla, is considering leaving the council as well, a source said. \nThe remaining members are said to be trying to exert some measure of influence with Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway by reaching out to her directly, unsure whether the council will retain influence with the campaign. But Trump-world feels the Hispanic advisers overplayed their hands and overreacted in the heat of the moment during the August meeting, with many of them not being seen as true believers in Trump. \n\u201cThat was really the RNC\u2019s fault,\u201d a Trump staffer said. \nMoving forward, the \u201canswer is to look closely at who is on the list,\u201d the staffer continued. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be controversial, you should be 1000% behind Trump. If you have a different position on immigration that\u2019s fine, but you shouldn\u2019t be advising him.\u201d \nLeslie Sanchez, the longtime operative who wrote the book Los Republicanos, Why Hispanics and Republicans Need Each Other, said she has seen the problems that doomed the Hispanic advisory council from the start. \nShe recalled speaking at a conference when John McCain and Ted Kennedy were in the middle of trying to pass immigration legislation, when Republicans told her they couldn\u2019t attend because they didn\u2019t want to be seen supporting \u201camnesty.\u201d They didn\u2019t understand that she wasn\u2019t there to talk about immigration, she said. \nMoving forward, she argued, Republicans have to question the impact of ethnic advisory groups that should instead focus on policy. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to grow up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need policy collaboratives, not ethnic collaboratives, which tend to marginalize more people. Why are we still on this special Hispanic bus?\u201d \nThe Trump effort was a \u201csad, anemic clone of yesteryear and what authentic, inclusive Hispanic outreach operations should look like,\u201d she said. \nCalifornia Republican strategist Luis Alvarado, said the advisory council has just been smoke and mirrors to attain earned media to sustain the campaign\u2019s message that it was dipping its toe into Hispanic outreach. \n\u201cThey could barely muster sufficient bodies for a photo opp at Trump Tower,\u201d he said. \nAlvarado will be joining Muniz, chair of the Texas Federation of Hispanic Republicans, who is putting together a group of Hispanic conservatives who will meet along with others, like Jacob Monty, the day of the scheduled third debate Oct. 19, to plot a way forward for Republicans on Latino issues. \nStill, some Hispanic Trump supporters say while his immigration speech wasn\u2019t ideal, they are still on board and the council still has important work to do. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said some of the things he said in Arizona but he\u2019s unorthodox,\u201d said Rick Figueroa, one of the few Texas council members left, adding that it is important to have their voices at the table. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to meet with the campaign and Mr. Trump again.\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t agree with everything he said in the speech but we can focus on the things we agree on,\u201d said Jesus Marquez, a Nevada radio host, who stressed he believes the council will continue to have influence. \u201cThis is not over.\u201d \nAs has often been the case, even when Trump doubles down on hardline rhetoric, some of his supporters believe he will still soften his tone and policies at a vaguely later date. \nIleana Garcia, who started Latinas for Trump, before speaking to the campaign and eventually joining Great America PAC, predicted that Trump will pivot for good \u2014 soon. \n\u201cHe\u2019s gotta cater to the hardcore, to the Ann Coulters, but at the same time he has to cater to his Hispanic and his African American employees,\u201d she said. \u201cEs una buena persona (he\u2019s a good person).

As part of its efforts to double-down on its grassroots investments, LIBRE Initiative, Generation Opportunity and Concerned Veterans for America will now be able to operate in all 35 states where AFP, which has 2.5 million members, has a presence. \nCurrently, LIBRE is in 10 states, GenOpp is in 4 and CVA is in 16. \n\u201cAs we looked at how we could continue to double-down on our grassroots advantage, we decided merging our resources would help us leverage the infrastructure and operational efficiency of AFP to allow CVA, GenOpp and LIBRE to scale more rapidly across the country and into more communities to create this grassroots movement,\u201d said James Davis, spokesman for the network. \nThe changes \u2014 described as a \u201cstrategic scaling\u201d\u2014 will be implemented between November and January and will allow the smaller groups to use AFP offices and staff without making separate investments. Asked about any layoffs in case of redundancies, officials said personnel decisions have yet to be worked out but that they view the merger as an expansion. \n\u201cWe\u2019re looking ahead to 2017 and these changes will put us in a position to lead on policy when, no matter what the outcome of the election, the country will be looking for leadership,\u201d Davis said. \nThe three groups merging with AFP would still maintain their own brand and focus on targeting their specific demographic. \n\u201cThis is a natural direction of where all these groups, including AFP, wanted to go,\u201d said Levi Russell, spokesman for AFP. \u201cWe were already partners, but this makes it that much closer.\u201d \nThe LIBRE Initiative\u2019s Daniel Garza said the new integration with AFP across the country will allow the organization to be best positioned to amplify its message on policy issues like immigration legislation, with a newly elected president that the group does not support in either Trump or Clinton. \n\u201cContrary to popular belief we do have limited resources,\u201d Garza said, with a nod towards the Koch network\u2019s vast financial support. \nRegardless of who wins, Garza says AFP will be able to mobilize an army of people across the country to either oppose Clinton\u2019s policies or pressure Trump to keep his word. \n\u201cThere is a presumption he will be better on taxes, on regulation, on the Supreme Court, Obamacare, and Dodd-Frank but we don\u2019t know that,\u201d Garza said. \nThe Mexican-American Garza, who was a former member of the George W. Bush administration, said he wants the country to understand immigrants are a strength for America and acknowledged the education is often aimed at opposition from conservatives. \nHe said the new reorganization gives LIBRE a better opportunity to also share their expertise with other network groups, comparing it to the importance of reflecting diversity within the Latino community. \n\u201cWe work two-fold in that area \u2014 to educate the Latino community, but we also educate non-Latinos about Latinos and Latino priorities which are American priorities,\u201d he said.

Franklin / AP ID: 9545067 \nPHOENIX \u2014 Talk of a humane appoach, or a \u201csoftening\u201d on immigration by Donald Trump, gave way to his trademark tough talk of building a wall and rounding up \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d during an immigration policy speech Wednesday at the Phoenix Convention Center, ending an 11-day trial balloon by his campaign. \nEarlier in the day, Trump visited Mexico at the invitation of its president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Afterward, the Mexican leader said that he told Trump his country would not pay for a wall along the border as he has said Mexico would, after Trump saying the issue didn\u2019t come up. \nFor Trump\u2019s raucous fans in the crowd, the Mexico trip was wonderful, showcasing the statesman side of the Republican nominee. But they were ecstatic that instead of pivoting on immigration, he completed a 360 back to his original position. \n\u201cWhen he first started last year he was foot in the sand, we need to go at these issues as hard as possible,\u201d said Patrick Blair, a Trump supporter, who develops surgery centers. \u201cAt the town hall with [Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity] he was talking about softening, so I thought he would back off 10%, but he did not and I\u2019m happy with what he came out with, a lot of details, he had 10 points \u2014 it was more than I thought he would have.\u201d \nFor most of Trump\u2019s supporters like Blair, they came for the wall, and they got what they wanted, along with a plan to triple the number of ICE deportation agents. Trump even called them a \u201cdeportation task force\u201d for those who have evaded justice \u2014\u201clike Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \nTrump also said he would end the so-called \u201ccatch and release\u201d of undocumented immigrants and have zero tolerance for \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d whom he would begin deporting on day one. He did not specify how that policy would differ from that of the Obama administration, which has prioritized the removal of criminals. Just last week, as Trump openly pondered an immigration pivot before ultimately abandoning it, he noted that Obama had deported a record number of immigrants. \nBut the lingering questions didn\u2019t bother his supporters much, even some who differ with him on his trademark policy proposal. \n\u201cHe really doubled down tonight,\u201d said Michael Toppeta, who works in information technology, voted for Gary Johnson in 2012 and has supported Ron Paul in the past. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t agree with the wall, it\u2019s not unreasonable,\u201d he said, adding that defending the Second Amendment and protecting the conservative balance of the Supreme Court are two big reasons he supports Trump. \nCarol Walters, who came from Chicago and has lived in Arizona for 14 years, wasn\u2019t in the middle of the crowd. She sat in a wheelchair toward the back, but she loved what she heard and said the wall is necessary because the United States is being flooded with undocumented immigrants. \n\u201cThey\u2019re on welfare, food stamps, all the freebies, who\u2019s paying for that? You and I,\u201d she said. Leaning in, she said when undocumented immigrants go to the emergency room, they should pay some of the bill. \u201cThey should at least have some of it,\u201d she said. \n\u201cAfter what he did in Mexico I\u2019m very happy. I thought it was the best performance. It was presidential two men with opposite backgrounds discussing issues \u2014 I thought he was very professional about it,\u201d Walters added. \nBlair, like Walters, has developed a harder edge to his political views. He voted for McCain in 2008 and Romney in 2012, but laughed when he said he was one of the ones in the crowd who mercilessly booed when McCain\u2019s name was mentioned as a primary winner Tuesday by a Trump warm-up act. \nThe Mexico trip was a pleasant surprise, Blair said. \n\u201cPeople in Mexico weren\u2019t happy with what he said and the healing has to start sometime, he put an olive branch out,\u201d Blair said kindly, of the reaction to Trump\u2019s comments that Mexico sends criminals and rapists across the border. \nBut then added, \u201cMexico is our friend, we don\u2019t want a third-world enemy at our Southern border.\u201d \nIt was the kind of talk Willie Martinez, 25, standing out as one of the few Hispanics at the back of the room, had to hear for himself. \nThe West Phoenix native went to a high school that was 93% Latino, and he was a former Bernie Sanders supporter before turning to Hillary Clinton now. He came to the rally because he wanted to see if the media was fairly painting Trump\u2019s statements or just cutting them up into sound bites. \nThe media \u2014 a constant target of Trump, his campaign, and his supporters (who yelled \u201cdo your job!\u201d Wednesday night) \u2014 gained one fan in Martinez. \n\u201cFor the most part the media is pretty much right,\u201d he said after the rally, as satisfied Trump supporters walked past him. \u201cHe\u2019s just as crazy as people are saying he is.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

Franklin / AP ID: 9571194 \nPHOENIX \u2014 Before Donald Trump returned to the state for the fifth time, Latino groups here kept coming back to an old saying: \u201cDime con qui\u00e9n andas, y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres\u201d\u2014 tell me who you\u2019re with, and I\u2019ll tell you who you are. \nIn Arizona, the activists are quick to tell you, Donald Trump is with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the infamous hard-line sheriff of Maricopa County. \nKnown for his raids in heavily-Latino neighborhoods, and media-seeking, brutal measures \u2014 requiring inmates to don pink underwear or making them sleep outside in his \u201cTent City\u201d jail \u2014 the 84-year-old sheriff hasn\u2019t moderated. He has, however, become a constant presence during the 2016 campaign, frequently appearing before Trump in Arizona. \nAnd across the street from Trump\u2019s recent rally last week, protesters blasted ranchera songs, and held signs bearing things like, \u201cArizona rejects your racism. Dump Trump. Dump Arpaio.\u201d They didn\u2019t go inside the rally, fearing violence, but they linked the two men outside. Some groups drop the distinction: \u201cTrumpaio.\u201d \nThat idea \u2014 Trump and Arpaio as two-headed monster \u2014 is just the thing those activists hope could defeat Arpaio, deliver unprecedented Latino voting, and upend the landscape of Arizona politics. If 2016 has given new life to hardline immigration policies, activists think their community, who is also listening, can produce a sharp turn in the other direction. \nNew Hispanic voter registration and get out the vote efforts are underway \u2014 One Arizona, a coalition of more than a dozen groups created after the SB1070 immigration fight, recently launched an initiative to register 75,000 new Latino voters, but privately expects to get closer to 100,000. Canvassers in Phoenix, Pima County, and Tucson are out every day from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., targeting low-propensity voters. \nBazta Arpaio \u2014 a play on \u201cstop Arpaio\u201d in Spanish \u2014 is a political organization funded by Unbound Philanthropy\u2019s Four Freedoms Fund and is allowed to go after him, rather than just register voters. Taking the baton from groups like One Arizona, it is using its access to the NGP VAN voter data system, to target Latino voters that didn\u2019t vote in 2012 or those who turned 18 since the last election. The group currently has 20 staffers and is looking to add 100 canvassers for the painstaking door-to-door work. \n\u201cIt\u2019s about ending Arpaio\u2019s reign and stopping Trump\u2019s rise,\u201d said Carlos Garcia, a well-respected activist in the community who works to stop deportations of parents and families. \u201cTaking two people out with one vote.\u201d \nSince becoming sheriff in 1993, Arpaio has been re-elected five times. But he did not become a national figure until immigration battles in Arizona went cross-country in the past decade. His national celebrity has coincided with a series of legal battles that have embroiled his office and damaged his reputation in Arizona, however, particularly since his last re-election. \nIn 2013, a federal district court ruled Arpaio had racially profiled Hispanic drivers. Two years later, Arpaio said under oath that he had hired a private investigator to investigate a judge\u2019s wife. Three weeks ago, that same judge referred a ruling to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office to determine whether Arpaio should be held in criminal contempt of court for his repeated refusal to abide by orders to stop profiling. \nSeizing on Arpaio\u2019s problems with the law, activists believe him to be more vulnerable than ever. Longtime Arizona activist Dulce Matuz, who was undocumented for 12 years, said she couldn\u2019t help thinking of Arpaio as she studied for her citizenship test and came upon a question about the \u201crule of law.\u201d \nArpaio, she said, has acted as if he\u2019s \u201cuntouchable\u201d and above the law. \u201cHe was investigating the judge\u2019s wife, who is he to do that to a federal judge?\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s weaker than ever and that\u2019s because of the community,\u201d Viridiana Hernandez of Bazta Arpaio said, adding that what is being exposed in court is what Latinos already knew Arpaio was doing. A common chant at protests has long been \u201cArrest Arpaio, not the people!\u201d \n\u201cCommunity members are no longer afraid \u2014 the same community members that were targeted and separated, those are the same people organizing and hitting the streets,\u201d she said. \nBut despite the energy, much will depend on whether some Republican voters turn on Arpaio. \nSeated under a white board that reads \u201cEnjoy the ride\u201d and \u201c#ItsTime,\u201d Paul Penzone \u2014 the same man that Arpaio defeated four years ago by six points \u2014 looks the part of a detective from \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and at 49-years-old is seen as a more seasoned challenger by Democrats. He was quick to say Republicans walk up to him to tell him they support him this time around. \n\u201cWell, why not last time?\u201d he recalled saying to one. \n\u201cI\u2019m tired of the sheriff, I\u2019m tired of the nonsense,\u201d the voter responded. \nBut there are also those who write him off because of his party identification. \n\u201cI encounter that,\u201d Penzone acknowledged. \n\u201cBut you have to simplify the message. If you or your family is in need of law enforcement to protect them, you don\u2019t care who shows up at the door, whether there\u2019s a D or R next to their name, you care that they\u2019re competent,\u201d he said. Talking about the Trump immigration speech hours later, Penzone joked he would give someone a \u201cc-note\u201d if they wore a Paul Penzone for Sheriff sign to the rally. \nAnd while the rally was full of Arpaio fans, he garnered 60,000 less votes a day earlier in the Republican primary than he did in 2012, even though more people voted this time around. \nTurning to the general election, polling has been scant. A Penzone commissioned poll showed him up by 4, while a Republican firm showed him up 45-42. Mary Altaffer / AP ID: 9583461 \nArpaio plays dirty, Penzone argued, showing BuzzFeed News one of the sheriff\u2019s flyers, which detailed how the Democrat will give porn and cigarettes back to inmates and that he\u2019s soft on the border and is going to let ISIS in. (Penzone, meanwhile, said, \u201cArpaio brought up his age last night, his energy. I\u2019m not going to judge him on his age, I\u2019m going to judge him on his record, which has diminished, but I\u2019m going to let him answer for the reason for that. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s spending most of his time in court.\u201d) \nHe\u2019s floated some changes to Arpaio policies \u2014 an end to racial profiling and a focus instead on immigration enforcement on criminal organizations that bring drugs into the country. But he\u2019s less firm on what his election would mean for tent city\u2019s fate. He may eliminate it if it\u2019s a drag on taxpayers or he may keep it, he said. \nSo activists aren\u2019t exactly in love with him, not entirely unlike the voters who say Trump is unacceptable but Clinton isn\u2019t great herself. That\u2019s fine with Penzone. \n\u201cI don\u2019t expect to be a white knight, but I do expect a fair evaluation of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d he said, stressing that he will work with activists in good faith. \nPenzone said he has worked with the Hispanic community his whole career, focusing on getting drug traffickers out of neighborhoods, with the Testigo Silencioso or Silent Witness program. He said he had two detectives who were bilingual do outreach to Hispanics so \u201cthey didn\u2019t have to come to us.\u201d \nGarcia of Bazta Arpaio said he would meet with Penzone if he wins, but the experience with Arpaio means he will enter the meeting with eyes wide open, and won\u2019t be easily swayed. \n\u201cIf we go talk to Penzone of course he\u2019s going to tell us he\u2019s going to give us the moon and the stars,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut if Penzone decides to be Arpaio we\u2019re going to be standing in the same place in four years to get him out.\u201d \nOn the heels of Spanish-language media in the state banding together to register Latino voters , Univision and Mi Familia Vota invited Arpaio and Penzone to a September 20 debate, but only Penzone has accepted, BuzzFeed News has learned. If Arpaio does not accept, the event will be turned into a townhall conversation with Penzone. \nPenzone said he\u2019s worried about two things \u2014 voter turnout and having enough polling stations, after issues during the primary because of reduced polling stations and unexpectedly high turnout. In Phoenix, where Latinos comprise 40% of the population, the New Yorker recently reported , \u201cThere was one station for every hundred and eight thousand residents. Some precincts in the south of the city, where the majority is Latino, had no polling places at all.\u201d \n(The year after Penzone last ran, in 2013, the Supreme Court overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act, which allowed Arizona to reduce the number of polling stations without federal review.) \nThis year, voting regulation changes in Arizona no longer allow groups like One Arizona, a nonpartisan 501C3, to collect ballots from residents, which the group says was helpful when dealing with lower propensity Latino voters. \n\u201cThat was important because you have to keep reminding people,\u201d said Pita Juarez of One Arizona. \u201cThat\u2019s when that came in handy, \u2018Your ballot is due in two days, I can even take it for you, if you want.\u2019\u201d \nActivists have also taken things beyond the election, to what they call direct action. When Bruce Halle, the multi-billionaire owner of Discount Tire, put signs in the windows of his stores last month reading, \u201cRe-Elect Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u201d he was picketed for four weeks by Bazta Arpaio and other groups until the signs were taken down. They\u2019ve bristled too that Democrats are taking credit for things they\u2019re doing \u2014\u201cStop stealing the credit from a 17-year-old kid who is registering people to vote because his mom is undocumented,\u201d Juarez said was her message to local Democrats. \nBut in the last month the party\u2019s coordinated campaign field efforts have seen investment from the Clinton campaign and a small, six-figure Arizona ad buy was announced last week. The Arizona Democratic Party has 160 field staff and is focusing on hiring organizers that are fluent in Spanish. Penzone has been added to the coordinated field efforts and the party is highlighting his candidacy when it speaks to Maricopa County voters. \n\u201cAs we engage Latino voters with this particular race, we\u2019re not just talking about how terrible Arpaio has been for Maricopa County, but we\u2019re educating voters on the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee,\u201d said Arizona Democratic spokesman Enrique Gutierrez, citing daily phone banks and canvassing shifts to warn voters of the danger of continuing Arpaio\u2019s policies. \nRuben Alvarez, co-founder of Molera Alvarez, and a 25-year Republican veteran of Arizona politics, said defeating Arpaio will still be a challenge: Voter registration is dominated by the Republican vote and he has raised millions of dollars from donors outside of the state. \n\u201cOne of the reasons [Penzone] lost the last time around is because he was painted in a negative way by Arpaio\u2019s campaign,\u201d Alvarez said, advising Penzone to harp on what Arpaio\u2019s legal problems are costing taxpayers. \nDemocrats say the real impact of having two divisive figures on the ballot is that it is accelerating the demographic changes that were already happening in Arizona. \n\u201cThe Democratic shift is naturally occurring but what Trump is doing is helping us accelerate it,\u201d said a Clinton official. \u201cTrump and Arpaio are motivating people to get involved, whether we get there this year, we still have a lot of work to do. But this is accelerating it in a way we couldn\u2019t have planned for.\u201d \nBack in the Bazta Arpaio offices the next afternoon, Garcia and Hernandez mulled the question of what it would mean to the community to have Arpaio lose. \n\u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t know Arpaio, but I knew we should be afraid of him,\u201d Hernandez said, recalling that her parents once told her not to go protest in an area he patrolled. \u201cHe\u2019s been around 24 years \u2014 I\u2019ve been alive 25. But my niece, she\u2019s one, she doesn\u2019t need to know who the hell Arpaio is.\u201d \nBuzzFeed News\u2019 Adolfo Flores contributed reporting. Adrian Carrasquillo   Adrian Carrasquillo at .", "AP images ID: 9642776 \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Everyone knows Donald Trump descended an escalator at Trump Tower when he launched his campaign last summer saying Mexico sends criminals and rapists to the country, promising to build a wall and deport millions. \nAnd just weeks into her campaign, Hillary Clinton sat in a high school library to sketch out her proposal for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and pledged to go further than Obama\u2019s executive actions if Congress won\u2019t move a legislative fix. \nNo issue has been more central to the campaign. \nBuzzFeed News spoke with a wide-range of immigration stakeholders; activists who work with faith, law enforcement, the tech sector, and business; as well as undocumented activists, traditional Republicans, and a hardline Trump adviser, to find out what they expect to hear on the polarizing issue and what is left to say beyond the well-worn phrases of deportations and a wall or a path to citizenship and immigration reform. \u201cTrump\u2019s immigration plan does not treat immigrants like human beings.\u201d ID: 9659358 \nAli Noorani who has worked with faith, law enforcement, and business groups to put together a coalition on immigration as executive director of the National Immigration Forum said to avoid empty buzzwords that don\u2019t ultimately give anything of substance to viewers, both candidates should come prepared with details. For Clinton, what would her legislative package on immigration look like? And for Trump, how does he actually plan to deport millions of immigrants and do the necessary profiling to find them? \n\u201cClinton has the opportunity to tell the business community what a reformed legal immigration system means for the economy,\u201d Noorani said. \u201cTo law enforcement, how do her reforms to the immigration system keep the nation safe and allow law enforcement to retain trust of the immigrant community that they serve and protect? And to the faith community, how does Clinton\u2019s plan treat them like human beings and allow them to reach their fullest potential?\u201d \nNoorani argued that Trump will struggle to appeal to many outside his base on immigration. \u201cTrump\u2019s immigration plan does not treat immigrants like human beings,\u201d he said. \nA Washington Post analysis after Trump\u2019s not-actually-a-pivot illegal immigration speech in Phoenix, found that his plan would put 5 to 6.5 million immigrants at risk of deportation. Todd Schulte, executive director of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s immigration advocacy group FWD.us, said that his organization sees 6 million as the absolute minimum in danger of removal under Trump\u2019s plan and believes it is more in the range of 6 to 9 million. Citing polling that shows many independents and Republicans favor immigration fixes short of mass deportation, Schulte said Clinton should unapologetically lean into the issue at the debate. \n\u201cShe should go on the offense,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be shy in laying out that she has a clear vision on this issue.\u201d He added that many Americans just want someone to ultimately fix this problem and said her pledge to introduce immigration in the first 100 days of her presidency is something independent voters can get behind as well as the jaded, cautious activists rolling their eyes and saying they\u2019ve heard promises before. \u201cObama\u2019s approach of more deportations will lead us to reform, didn\u2019t work for him, and it won\u2019t work for her.\u201d ID: 9659937 \nCristina Jimenez, co-founder of United We Dream, is one such activist who has hit the Obama administration for deportations and wants Clinton to clearly articulate that she will make a clean break from Obama\u2019s enforcement policy. \u201cObama\u2019s approach of more deportations will lead us to reform, didn\u2019t work for him, and it won\u2019t work for her,\u201d Jimenez said. \nJimenez said the debate will be an opportunity for the Latino and immigrant communities to confront Trump\u2019s deportation doctrine. \n\u201cWe have seen he has committed to ending [Obama\u2019s executive] DACA program. My brother would be deported, my parents, nearly everyone in United We Dream,\u201d she said. \u201cIt contextualizes our work.\u201d \nBut Daniel Garza, who leads the conservative LIBRE Initiative, said that while he has opposed Trump\u2019s immigration plans from day one, he doesn\u2019t believe Clinton has successfully made the case that she can bring together consensus on what would still be a perilous post-election minefield. \nHe said Clinton has shown \u201ccontempt and derision\u201d in opposing driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants in the 2008 race and in 2014 when she said most unaccompanied children crossing the border from Central America should ultimately be sent back. Now, he says, she promises \u201cimmigration reform\u201d and going beyond Obama administratively, which he argued doesn\u2019t help efforts for consensus. \n\u201cWhat I want to hear from Hillary Clinton is that bipartisanship to reach consensus is the only positive way,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t give me platitudes, don\u2019t give me empty rhetoric, give me something pragmatic and achievable.\u201d \nStill, Garza said everyone is endowed with unalienable rights \u2014\u201cthose rights extend to the immigrant\u201d\u2014 and he hopes Trump will evolve on immigration, which he argued Trump has shown signs of, tempering his rhetoric and policies. \n\u201cWhat gives me hope on Donald Trump is I know he\u2019s by instinct a negotiator,\u201d Garza said. \u201cTo arrive at the deal he knows he has to give, at some point can he meet people in the middle? Will we get it? I have no idea.\u201d \u201cClinton is the radical on immigration.\u201d ID: 9659960 \nAJ Delgado, the firebrand Latina commentator who has supported Trump from day one before recently joining the campaign as a senior adviser, bristled at the idea that Trump has to change in large-scale ways, and said current events will once again drive his remarks on immigration at the debate. \n\u201cI expect Mr. Trump is going to highlight that immigration, especially with recent events, is a matter of national security,\u201d she said referring to the bombs planted in New York and New Jersey this past weekend by a man inspired by terrorists. \u201cI think that message, which is objectively an accurate message, is going to resonate with voters outside his base.\u201d \nLike Garza, Delgado said Clinton should have to answer for flip flopping on immigration at the debate, and said Clinton is the radical on immigration, not Trump. \n\u201cHow do you square that with a policy, now when you check her website, that is the most pro-illegal immigrant platform of any presidential candidate that I have read in modern history?\u201d \nMany Latino leaders view immigration as one of the most crucial parts of Monday\u2019s debate, but there is concern that the lack of a Hispanic moderator at any debate will stifle the substantive conversation needed on the issue. \u201c[Mass deportations] that is the argument of a child and fear-mongering at its worst.\u201d ID: 9659982 \nJavier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce said a Latino moderator was even more important during this election. \n\u201cOne of two candidates on that stage began his political career by insulting Mexicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThis notion that you\u2019re going to mass deport 11.5 million people, 9 million of whom are employed, not only is irresponsible, it\u2019s ridiculous. That is the argument of a child and fear mongering at its worst.\u201d \n\u201cImagine how prepared a Hispanic moderator would have been,\u201d Palomarez continued, \u201cwho has lived the reality of immigration reform and understands it?\u201d \nSaying that the debate commission \u201clacked the courage\u201d to make that decision, he said the current lineup excluding Hispanic journalists will be unlikely to ferret out the best responses on immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to Hispanic viewers and it\u2019s unfair to America.\u201d \nGarza agreed, saying it was up to not only the moderator Lester Holt on Monday, but also to the candidates, who he says have not shown themselves to be particularly astute on immigration. \n\u201cI worry that it will devolve into fingerpointing,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is going to make the case that will appeal to his base, Clinton will make the point that will appeal to her base, but America is is in the middle, with the consensus being that 12 million people should get legalization to stay here,\u201d short of citizenship. \nSchulte said immigration sometimes lends itself to what sounds like hyperbole, but Trump\u2019s is \u201cthe most hardline position in modern political history,\u201d which has raised the stakes for the first debate. \n\u201cImmigration, more than any other issue, is a referendum on who we are as a nation,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope it gets the time it deserves.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

But as Bernard listened a horrible realisation grew. The combinations used individual drugs that he had either already taken and become resistant to, or were so similar in their chemical structure that they would most likely not work on him. \u201cI thought, Well, it\u2019s great that lots of people are going to benefit, but I\u2019m not .\u201d \nHe was right. By 1999, Bernard was dying; the medication not only failing but also flooding his organs with so much toxicity as to trigger chemically induced hepatitis. Peter cared for him, tended to him, a 24-hour nurse. \n\u201cMy health became a full-time job,\u201d he says, looking away, describing just the surface effects \u2013 cheeks sunken, buttocks and legs deflated; the most infamous side effects of early HIV medication, lipoatrophy and lipodystrophy, where body fat either disappears or resurfaces elsewhere. \n\u201cI had so little energy,\u201d says Bernard. \u201cI could choose between doing one thing per day: I could go out to the local shops, or I could cook. My world shrank and shrank. I would just sit in a chair and look out the window, out at the world, and feel like I wasn\u2019t part of it.\u201d \nHe describes this time with a kind of baffled detachment, as if recounting a childhood nightmare. \u201cI would just sit in a chair and look out the window, out at the world, and feel like I wasn\u2019t part of it.\u201d ID: 9567437 \n\u201cI knew the chances of me making the millennium were slim,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to see 40. We both expected me to die.\u201d \nThe dynamic between the couple shifted starkly: from partners to patient/carer \u2013 and worse. \u201cI lost my sense of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI gave up my identity to become the person that Peter could take care of. He became my daddy and I was the boy: infantilised, no power, no autonomy. The relationship had to work like that, but I don\u2019t know who that person was. I was a shell.\u201d \nBernard was at least able to warn his family back in Britain that he was dying \u2013 a fortune many parents of gay men, especially the illiberal, did not share. \n\u201cI had found a man that was taking care of me, so I told them that so they didn\u2019t worry I was going to die alone,\u201d he says. His face is blank. \nAfter Bernard made it through the millennium, he read up on the latest treatments. From this research, he and his doctor, Julio Montaner \u2013 now an internationally acclaimed HIV expert \u2013 together devised a completely new combination, using eight different drugs, including a crucial new antiretroviral medication called Kaletra. Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553623 \n\u201cThe combination was incredibly experimental,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was either going to kill me or cure me.\u201d \nWithin just a couple of weeks he started to feel better. The amount of virus in his blood \u2013 called the viral load \u2013 started falling. He had terrible gastric side effects, but over a period of six months, Bernard\u2019s health improved dramatically. One day he went for a walk in Vancouver\u2019s Stanley Park. \n\u201cIt was the first time I was able to get up out of my chair,\u201d he says. \u201cI went out and it was like I was seeing in colour for the first time and I remember walking\u2026\u201d he inhales sharply, trying to keep control. His eyes fill. He swallows and starts again. \u201cI remember walking through the park and just seeing the beauty of nature and the sky and the trees and the mountains and the sea and this feeling like, \u2018This is amazing. I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m not going to die.\u2019\u201d \nBernard shifts in his chair, his face waking up, eyes darting around as if seeing a looming oasis. \u201cIt was that Lazarus moment. I came back from the dead.\u201d \nRegaining his health, his life, also meant regaining himself. \u201cI remember walking through the park and just seeing the beauty of nature and the sky and the trees and this feeling like, \u2018This is amazing.

The grief, says Bernard, surfaced and overwhelmed Peter, but Bernard could not look after him, could not return the favour. \n\u201cWhere I had been a very good patient, he wasn\u2019t. And where he was a great caregiver, I was not. We tried to salvage our relationship but we ended up hating each other.\u201d Bernard took a trip back to Britain to see friends, one of whom was living in Brighton on England\u2019s south coast. \n\u201cI instantly fell in love with the place and thought, I could live here. Vancouver is beautiful but I can\u2019t stay there; it just reminds me too much of my past, of all the ghosts, of Peter and AIDS. Now there\u2019s going to be a new chapter to my life .\u201d \nHe left Vancouver and moved to Brighton. Dispensing with the entertainment reporting of his earlier life, Bernard dedicated himself to writing about HIV/AIDS treatment, work that later morphed into campaigning to combat the criminalisation of HIV transmission. \nSex resumed too. In most cases, adhering to medication suppresses the virus to such low levels (referred to as \u201cundetectable\u201d) as to make HIV-positive people uninfectious \u2013 a fact that quelled Bernard\u2019s fear of passing it on. \u201cI remember I met someone who came here and he fucked me \u2013 the first time I\u2019d been fucked in a decade. This sense of, \u2018Oh my god! I can enjoy sex again!\u2019\u201d \nIn the early \u201900s he met his partner, Nick, who lives in Germany, but the distance \u2013 even after 13 years \u2013 works for them, he says: There is no danger of co-dependence. \nRealising he was not going to die was step one; realising he could might even reach old age was a second, slow awakening. \n\u201cIt was like being born again,\u201d he says. \u201cI basically lost my thirties, so I lived life again with a new vigour for everything. I could make plans \u2013 even a year or two years ahead.\u201d \nHe began to see someone new in the mirror, too: someone alive, gaining weight, a complexion imbued with colour, but cheeks still sunken, the permanent telltale mark of lipoatrophy. \n\u201cI would see the scars of the battles I\u2019d been fighting,\u201d he says. He started having a cosmetic filler treatment injected into his cheeks to plump out the ravines. It looks natural. He no longer has to confront a reflection of the past. \nBernard begins to talk about the box above his head, and what\u2019s in it, but before he goes any further he mentions a straight man he knows called Rob, whose story he thinks should be told. ID: 9553579 Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553640 \nRobert James, it emerges over the course of a morning, has the blackest sense of humour, which he deploys with a delicious cackle. \n\u201cI\u2019m an actual heterosexual \u2013 a breeder with AIDS!\u201d he chirps, sitting at a dining table strewn with papers and pills in his basement flat just a few streets away from Bernard. He walks with a stick. His dancing eyebrows, seasoned impishness, and reedy voice call to mind the comedian Eddie Izzard. \nJames was diagnosed when he was 19 in 1985, while living with his family in rural Somerset, England, and shortly before going to university \u2013 a place he had hoped would enable him to meet women. \n\u201cIt was a great time to get diagnosed with the worst disease in the world with which you would sexually kill all your girlfriends,\u201d he says with such brutal sarcasm it sucks the air out of the room. \u201cReally good timing.\u201d \u201cIt was a great time to get diagnosed with the worst disease in the world with which you would sexually kill all your girlfriends.\u201d ID: 9567462 \nHe also has haemophilia, the genetic disease that prevents blood clotting \u2013 in his case mostly internally, causing painful invisible bleeds that damage his joints. \nUntil 1985, when the medical profession started screening blood donations, the HIV virus was unknowingly contained in blood products \u2013 plasma, including a blood-clotting agent, extracted from numerous people\u2019s blood \u2013 with which James injected himself every few days for years. \n\u201cYou took the diseases of 20,000 people, concentrated them all together and then injected them into lots of people!\u201d he says, his voice rising in satire. \nThrough this, James also contracted hepatitis C, a virus that has many different forms, or \u201cgenotypes\u201d. He has several. Only some are curable. \nHe returns to the moment he was diagnosed with HIV. \u201cI went in with my dad and the doctor said she\u2019d got something to say, that she was really sorry but they\u2019d done a blood test and I\u2019ve got this thing, HTLV-111.\u201d It was a year before the international medical community had agreed to call the virus HIV. \nThe doctor did not tell James how long he had left to live. She did not know. No one did exactly, although at the time estimates tended to be about three years. \nHe cannot remember what he said in response, only how determined it made him. \u201cTo make sure I had a good time when I went to university,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I\u2019d probably not live long enough to finish the degree.\u201d Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553648 \nWhile studying in Swansea, James was open about being HIV-positive, which spawned a thousand assumptions. Mostly, that he was gay. \u201cI got used to coming out as straight,\u201d he says, laughing. \nMixing in left-wing circles at college in the 1980s meant that having HIV as a white, straight man granted him immediate \u201ccachet\u201d, he says. \n\u201cWe were in the middle of a period when identity politics was really powerful and through this [HIV] I was instantly given one. Having a friend with the \u2018gay plague\u2019 [as it was then sometimes called] was an important thing for them, so there was a sense of some people wanting to be my friend because it could add to their own credibility.\u201d \nThe parents of his girlfriends did not exactly feel the same. \n\u201cThey had nothing against me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey just wished I\u2019d fuck off and go out with someone else. They would see me as the person who was going to kill their daughter.\u201d He pauses. \n\u201cThey never admitted that.\u201d \nWhen relationships ended, James faced thoughts few students have to contend with. \n\u201cIt would be, I\u2019m never to going to meet anyone else again, I\u2019m just going to get horribly ill and die ,\u201d he says, before segueing on to a broader discussion about his social life at university. \n\u201cI got drunk a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cTo manage the ups and downs.\u201d \nLife expectancy around HIV would increase a little during the 1980s as more data was collected, but still, James realised that in all likelihood, rather than three years in total, he would probably have three years from when he first became ill. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain freedom in it: \u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter if I mess things up, because I\u2019m not going to get to the end, so I\u2019m here for a good time,\u2019\u201d he says, before admitting, \u201cIt\u2019s bloody depressing quite a lot of the time.\u201d And annoyingly, he adds, he didn\u2019t get ill at university. \u201cSo I had to do the bloody exams.\u201d Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553667 \nWith extraordinary good fortune, James remained in relative good health for several years after university and moved to Hertfordshire with his girlfriend. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m gonna get ill at some point and when I do I\u2019ve got three years. I need to build up savings so I can live OK for three years. That\u2019s my plan .\u201d He told his then girlfriend what they would do when that happened: \u201cWe\u2019ll move back to Swansea and I\u2019ll die on the Gower [a famously beautiful peninsula in the Welsh city]. Because I thought that would be a nice place to die.\u201d \nJames stops, suddenly realising how dramatic this sounds \u2013 he hates the dramatic \u2013 and explains, \u201cIt becomes normal to have that conversation.\u201d \nIt also became normal for him not to think about any long-term career, he says, or how much he was being paid, but to simply embark on jobs because they were interesting. He worked in various fields related to HIV or health: the drugs sector, homelessness, the St John Ambulance service. \u201cI drifted around,\u201d he says. Whenever anyone mentioned the word \u201cpension\u201d he would laugh. His friends began to die of AIDS. \nThe British government, meanwhile, started giving haemophiliacs who had contracted HIV \u201crecompense\u201d\u2013 compensation. \n\u201cNewspapers would call us the \u2018innocent victims\u2019,\u201d says James, with sneering disgust for the judgment this implied about others with HIV. \nOne day, after John Major\u2019s government had decided to give HIV-positive haemophiliacs \u00a320,000 \u201cto stop us taking the government to court\u201d, James took the cheque into the building society. \n\u201cThe woman behind the till said, \u2018Ooh wow, you\u2019re lucky.\u2019\u201d \nIn some regards, she was not wrong. James dodged all the major illnesses that prey on those with late-stage HIV: the pneumonias, the cancers. But as the years ticked by, with no effective treatment, James\u2019 trust in doctors dwindled. So when combination therapy arrived in 1996 he was not exactly filled with optimism. He had moved to Brighton, partly on account of the fact that it has good coffee shops. He went to his new local HIV clinic. \n\u201cI thought, I really should introduce myself and say, \u2018When I get ill and die I\u2019m going to need you. Up until then I really don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point me coming in.\u2019 But the doctor wouldn\u2019t hear a word of it. She said, \u2018You should start on treatment.\u2019\u201d His CD4 count at the time was 150, dangerously low. \n\u201cI said, \u2018Treatment is a waste of time.\u2019 And she got very angry and said, \u2018No it\u2019s not, it\u2019s saving people\u2019s lives and you\u2019ve really got to do this.\u2019\u201d It was just after the Vancouver conference. \u201cI said, \u2018Treatment is a waste of time.\u2019 And she got very angry and said, \u2018No it\u2019s not, it\u2019s saving people\u2019s lives and you\u2019ve really got to do this.\u2019\u201d ID: 9567467 \nJames thought she was talking \u201ccrap\u201d but read about it nonetheless. \u201cI saw some of the stuff from the conference and was like, \u2018Oh my god, it works. Wow.\u2019 So I went back to the clinic and said, \u2018Alright.\u2019 At the time they were saying, \u2018We think this will guarantee you at least another six months of life.\u2019\u201d But within six months of taking it, he says, that expectation had swelled to five years. \nThe medication worked. James didn\u2019t have a Lazarus effect like Bernard\u2019s \u2013 he hadn\u2019t been ill enough to experience a dramatic physical improvement \u2013 but instead came an existential one. He now had to grasp that he would live. This took years. \n\u201cIt comes very slowly because there was always the fear of [drug] resistance, and then the next fear was getting a lymphoma or cancer that will kill you but it might not be for 10 years.\u201d His friend Anna took him aside. \n\u201cShe said I\u2019ve got to stop living like I was going to die. I would still make comments like, \u2018I don\u2019t need to bother with a pension or having a healthy diet because I\u2019ll be dead long before it gets me,\u2019 and she got fed up with me making the same comments. That made me think, Actually, yes, I am going to live .\u201d Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553736 \nThis process was beset with other realisations. \u201cThere were moments of, Oh my god, I\u2019m going to have to work another 30 years. I hadn\u2019t thought of that . And, Yeah, I am going to retire, so I have to do something [about that]. Have I paid my National Insurance contributions? It hits you in waves. What am I going to do in work for 30 years? What do I want to do? \u201d He started saving for a pension and thinking about work differently, seeking more security. He\u2019s now a lecturer in law. \nJames found himself facing the previously unthinkable prospect of reaching old age. \n\u201cAll that deterioration that I thought would be nicely condensed into a three-year period before death now might get stretched out,\u201d he says, laughing wryly. \nSomething else happened: HIV went from being his most urgent, threatening illness, to the least. It suddenly dawned on James that he would have to do something about the hepatitis C, a slow-burning deterioration of the liver that can take 30 years to destroy it \u2013 decades he never thought he would see. \nHis haemophilia has been thrust into the foreground, too, not least because of what state he might be in physically with the condition in retirement. Over time, internal bleeding corrodes joints, which deform as they regrow. \nHis elbows are nobbled, distorted by the disease. Both his ankles have been operated on to fuse the bones together properly. Until those recent operations, the pain he was living with was worse, he says, than any pain he experienced through HIV. \nAfter several relationships, James is single. \u201cI actually like it,\u201d he says. Partly, he adds, because he gets bored easily, but also, \u201cI\u2019m very bad at letting people look after me.\u201d \nIn a few weeks he turns 50. \n\u201cI remember thinking it\u2019d be amazing to get to the year 2000,\u201d he says. \u201cSo 50 is really nice \u2013 I can say that I\u2019m alive.\u201d \u201cI remember thinking it\u2019d be amazing to get to the year 2000, so 50 is really nice \u2013 I can say that I\u2019m alive.\u201d ID: 9567473 \nHe begins to reflect on 1996 and the effect combination therapy had on his generation. \u201cIf treatment hadn\u2019t come along, if it had been another 10 years, I may well have died. We survived just because we were lucky.\u201d There is a tinge of something in his voice: guilt. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can live through a whole group of your peers and friends dying and not feel at some point it\u2019s unfair that I survived and they didn\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI got lucky.\u201d \nThere is someone else who shares this sense of luck. Someone who also knows James. She says she is privileged \u2013\u201ctoo privileged\u201d, a description few could fit with the story that begins to unfold. ID: 9553583 \nIt is September 1996 and a 35-year old woman walks into Newham General Hospital, in east London. She is emaciated, broken, and close to death. \nHer name is Winnie Ssanyu-Sseruma. \nThe doctors ask her who she is and why she is there, and run tests on her. They are aghast at what they find. A healthy person\u2019s immune system will show a CD4 count of between 500 and 1600. Ssanyu-Sseruma\u2019s is 1. Any passing infection could kill her. The doctors ask more questions: Where have you been? How did you get like this? What is your immigration status? \nShe begins to tell them. They plead with her to return, so they can tend to her, monitor her, and administer the new drugs. But Ssanyu-Sseruma is not interested. She is ready to die. Laura Gallant / BuzzFeed ID: 9553750 \nTwenty years later, Ssanyu-Sseruma sits in her living room in Walthamstow, London, revisiting that time. Her eyes are wide and fill often; her voice is soft and low \u2013 smoky. A monochrome picture hangs in the hallway behind us. It is Ssanyu-Sseruma in the 1990s, a detailed drawing drafted from a photograph of her face. You cannot see how thin she had become. \nSsanyu-Sseruma was born in Sheffield, England, in 1961, but aged 2 moved with her parents back to their country: Uganda. It was a family of seven. Now it is four. \nAfter winning a scholarship at 19 to study in Kansas, Ssanyu-Sseruma moved east to Maryland in 1988 for an internship, and for which she was told a full medical check was required, including an HIV test. \n\u201cWhen I was told that the test came back positive I was thinking, Surely HIV-positive has to be good? Positive is good, negative is bad ,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the guy said, \u2018HIV-positive means you have the HIV virus and there\u2019s no cure. There\u2019s no medicine. So we can\u2019t determine how long you\u2019re going to live.\u2019 He said it in a very blas\u00e9 way \u2013 as he was sitting down, getting his chair sorted. I was numb.\u201d \nFrom that moment, she says, her life changed dramatically. She vowed to tell no one. \n\u201cAt that time, everything in the news was very grim [regarding HIV],\u201d she says. \u201cIn Uganda HIV was well-known. The impact on people there, on whole villages \u2013 everybody just died. I didn\u2019t know any women living with HIV [in the US] and the stigma\u2026the combination of those things told me, \u2018Just shut up.\u2019\u201d It also, she says, took time to understand the condition and how long she might have left. \n\u201cI thought I would just drop dead, walking on the street. So I lived life like I could die any minute. If I was sitting somewhere with friends I would think, This might be the last time I sit with these people. I would walk in a daze, bumping into people, thinking that death could come and what could that mean?\u201d \u201cI thought I would just drop dead, walking on the street. If I was sitting somewhere with friends I would think, This might be the last time I sit with these people .\u201d ID: 9567488 \nThe clinic in Maryland treated her sensitively, however. \u201cI told them that I need to come to the clinic when there was no one from my [Ugandan] community there.\u201d At the time in Uganda, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of talk about being bewitched\u201d surrounding those with HIV. And there was another, more graphic name used instead of HIV: Slim. \n\u201cIf you got it you started to lose weight. Everybody knew, and you were taken somewhere \u2013 hidden away at your request, or it\u2019d be the family\u2019s decision \u2013 and died a really undignified death.\u201d By 1990 around 1 in 6 adults in Uganda had HIV. \nShe feared that if she was seen at the Maryland clinic by fellow Ugandans, news of her HIV status would reach her family \u2013 news that would destroy them. \nIn 1990, Ssanyu-Sseruma discovered that one of her brothers was also living with the virus; the same year her mother died of cancer. Her brother died of HIV-related tuberculosis in 1992. The following year, her father died of cancer. Winnie Ssanyu-Sseruma ", "Your Post Has Been Launched! Fabulous! Don't forget to share with your friends on Twitter and Facebook. This year, the Fox News and radio host\u2019s shows have become an object of fascination, rage, and at times mockery. But Hannity isn\u2019t doing anything he hasn\u2019t done before \u2014 he\u2019s as loyal as ever. In the Trump era, though, that\u2019s turned him into a polarizing figure. Rosie Gray BuzzFeed News Reporter \nOn Tuesday evening, Sean Hannity had a special guest. It was someone who has played an important role in highlighting Hillary Clinton\u2019s email and foundation scandals, someone who threw a wrench into the election by bringing questionable behavior among Democrats to light. Long story short, this person was the perfect Hannity guest. \nThe weird thing about it was that it was Julian Assange. The WikiLeaks founder appeared from his exile in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, clad in a suit, beamed across the Fox News airwaves to Hannity\u2019s studio in New York, and causing cognitive dissonance everywhere as Hannity questioned Assange on upcoming Clinton releases that Assange promises are coming. WikiLeaks has already been a player in this election, making waves earlier this summer when it released unflattering hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. \nThen, Hannity signed off with some praise for the man he once criticized. \u201cI do hope you get free someday,\u201d the host told him. \u201cI wish you the best.\u201d \nHannity has said that he isn\u2019t a journalist and that he openly wants Trump to win. The Assange interview was the apotheosis of Hannity\u2019s commitment to doing what it takes to oppose Clinton: going after her even if it meant giving a sympathetic platform to an anti-American, pro-Russian figure hated by the right. \nThis year, Hannity\u2019s program has become an object of fascination, rage, and at times mockery, particularly among the conservatives still not on board with Donald Trump. Hannity is one of the loudest voices in the media constellation of Trump boosters \u2014 from Breitbart News, whose chairman is now the CEO of the Trump campaign, to Matt Drudge \u2014 who appear at times to work in tandem with the campaign. Any casual viewer of Hannity\u2019s television show or listener to his radio program can see that Hannity devotes a large amount of time to Trump. The New York Times reported that Hannity has even become a kind of informal adviser to the candidate. \nBut Hannity isn\u2019t the one who\u2019s changed. He gave John McCain and Mitt Romney similarly generous treatment when it came to the general election. The difference this time is that Trump is an intensely polarizing figure, and Hannity has broken with much of the conservative punditry establishment in backing him to such a pronounced degree. His show is now a glimpse into the mind-meld of a certain segment of the conservative media with Trump\u2019s campaign and the movement he represents. Hannity\u2019s story plays into some dominant themes of this election; how the Trump campaign has broken new ground by becoming a sort of media organization in its own right, and how the conservative movement has tried and failed to stamp out the ascendant nationalist Trumpist movement, forcing longtime conservative warriors like Hannity to either get on board or risk irrelevance. Winning has become an ideology of its own, and Hannity is dead set on winning. \n\u201cIt\u2019s boosterism,\u201d said Brad Thor, a conservative author who has harshly criticized Trump but thinks highly of Hannity, whom he says \u201chas always been very nice to me,\u201d in an email last month. \u201cSean, Drudge, and Breitbart saw a wave coming and they decided to ride it. That\u2019s their job \u2014 to do well. They are private businesses. And they have done very well backing Trump.\u201d \n\u201cConservatives in general, though, have been far too trusting of rightwing media to be gatekeepers and ambassadors of their brand,\u201d Thor said. \u201cNot all of us are aligned.\u201d \u201cI told the audience what I was going to do, I did it, and now people are critical I did it that way,\u201d Hannity says. ID: 9586026 \nHannity says this isn\u2019t his first time coming under fire for his aggressive advocacy. \n\u201cEight years ago I was vetting Obama in probably the most aggressive fashion in the country,\u201d Hannity told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI took a lot of heat then. I had prominent conservatives calling me and saying I was ruining my career.\u201d \nAnd Hannity points out that he never hid his intentions. In speeches to CPAC last year and this year, Hannity said that he would give each of the primary candidates as much time as possible on radio and TV and that he would support whoever the voters chose as the nominee. Hannity sees this as \u201ca service to the audience.\u201d \n\u201cI told the audience what I was going to do, I did it, and now people are critical I did it that way,\u201d Hannity says. \nHannity says there hasn\u2019t been an honest effort on the part of the media to understand his motivations: \u201cNobody who interviews me gives a rip about why I do what I do and say what I say,\u201d he said. \nStill, friends and friendly colleagues \u2014 and Hannity has many \u2014 don\u2019t quite know what to make of this year. Some are dismayed with Hannity\u2019s Trump support; others think he\u2019s been criticized too harshly for doing what he always has. He\u2019s known as a hard worker, spending hours a day on air both on the radio and on TV. \u201cHe is the most loyal and kind person to work for and he\u2019s passionate,\u201d said a former Hannity producer. \n\u201cHe gets to know everyone\u2019s staff and he really is just such a friendly person, and what\u2019s almost refreshing about it for people is he\u2019s not corrupted by being a New York City star,\u201d said Elise Jordan, a Republican operative who worked on Rand Paul\u2019s campaign and who used to go on Hannity\u2019s show semi-regularly. \n\u201cI just don\u2019t get the whole outrage over his role in this election,\u201d Jordan said, noting that Hannity has been open about not being a journalist and that she believes Hannity would do the same with any Republican nominee. \u201cI might completely disagree with his ideology but I still really like him and think the world of him as a person.\u201d \nBut his role vis-a-vis Trump this cycle has confounded many, including colleagues at Fox. \u201cI don\u2019t watch his show anymore,\u201d said one Fox News source. \u201cIt\u2019s very predictable. He\u2019s had Donald Trump on more than anyone, and how many of those shows have made news? None.\u201d \n\u201cI will enthusiastically pull the lever for Donald Trump,\u201d Hannity said, reeling off a list of issues including the Supreme Court, border security, and taxes, on which he believes Trump is clearly a better choice than Clinton. Conservatives who are still resisting Trump, Hannity said, should \u201csuck it up\u201d and are showing a \u201cstubbornness and arrogance that is bordering on sabotage, because I think some elites want to be able to stick their fingers in the faces of the voters.\u201d \u201cI can understand ratings\u2026 I can\u2019t understand the abandonment of conservatism.\u201d ID: 9586030 \nSome ascribe a more cynical motive to Hannity when it comes to Trump: ratings. \n\u201cI can understand ratings,\u201d the Fox News source said. \u201cI don\u2019t like them, but I understand them. I can\u2019t understand the abandonment of conservatism.\u201d \nHannity, a registered Conservative in New York, argues that it\u2019s his critics who are the ones doing the abandoning. \nThe ratings are good, however. His radio program, which has been syndicated since the day before the 9/11 attacks, is only bested by Rush Limbaugh when it comes to audience size. According to Nielsen ratings figures provided by a Fox News spokesperson, Hannity\u2019s TV show averages 2.4 million in total viewers and 500,000 in the 25-54 demographic, and is up double-digits from the same time last year. \nThose shows have seen different iterations over the last 15 years. For 12 years, Hannity wasn\u2019t just Hannity: He was one half of Hannity & Colmes , facing off every night against liberal co-host Alan Colmes. The program was in the vein of the Crossfire -style point-counterpoint programs that have now gone by the wayside in favor of greater ideological uniformity at the cable networks. Hannity told the New York Times in 1999 that Roger Ailes had asked him, \u201cYou know any good liberals?\u201d and that the show\u2019s working title had been \u201cHannity & LTBD\u201d\u2014\u201cLiberal To Be Determined.\u201d Colmes left in 2008. Hannity appears to think fondly of him; in 2013, he told the Hollywood Reporter that the two talk \u201calmost every day.\u201d Alan Colmes (left) and Hannity Duffy-marie Arnoult / WireImage ID: 9586081 \nYears later, Hannity still relies on the occasional liberal guest to spice things up. But in Colmes\u2019 absence, his show has struck many as becoming one-note \u2014 sometimes literally, as Hannity has hosted a number of townhalls with Trump that take up the entire show. \nAt his core, Hannity is a party guy despite his image as a smashmouth conservative talker. While he often criticizes Republican establishment figures, in the end he\u2019s most interested in taking on liberals and defeating Democrats electorally. \u201cHannity has long been among the biggest party loyalists on talk radio. While he would identify himself as a conservative first and a Republican second, he has long embraced a party leadership role,\u201d said Brian Rosenwald, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies conservative media. Rosenwald says he has \u201cuncovered tons of cases in which he emceed rallies, hosted fundraisers, etc for GOP candidates.\u201d \nThat enthusiasm for party sent Hannity down a peculiar path over the last five years. After the Republicans failed to win the White House in 2012, Hannity announced that he was \u201cevolving\u201d on immigration and that he supported a pathway to citizenship \u2014 in line with the thinking at the time. On air, he was friendly with Marco Rubio, who then seemed poised to be the next GOP nominee. \nThe evolution didn\u2019t last long. And in the run-up to the 2016 election, with the Gang of Eight immigration bill fiasco a close memory, Hannity no longer evinced an affinity for establishment figures and causes. \nLast year, Hannity interviewed several of the presumptive presidential candidates onstage at the Conservative Political Action Conference. According to two sources, Hannity became agitated backstage before Jeb Bush\u2019s appearance. There were rumors that the crowd would loudly boo Bush and even walk out of the venue. Hannity \u201cfreaked out,\u201d according to a source who witnessed the scene. Worried about being booed, Hannity attempted to convince Bush to change to a sit-down interview to calm the crowd. Bush ended up going ahead with his original plan of standing up, but \u201cHannity had to be talked off a ledge,\u201d the source said. \nHannity disputes that characterization of the incident, saying that when he was giving his own speech to CPAC earlier that day and mentioned Bush, whose name was booed, and that he had simply warned Bush about the booing. \u201cI just had a standing ovation \u2014 why would I be afraid to go out there?\u201d Hannity said. \u201cNumber one, I\u2019m actually very chill, I don\u2019t freak out. I can do this in my sleep.\u201d \nThe interview itself went on without incident, and no walkout occurred. Hannity is known for his kid-glove approach to Republican politicians of whom he approves, and for a while most of the Republican candidates could count on his show as a safe haven to spread their message and not have to answer tough questions. Hannity hosted hour-long townhalls with Cruz and Trump during the primary, a practice he has continued with Trump in the general election. Hannity told BuzzFeed News that he offered Cruz a town hall every time he offered Trump one during the waning days of the primary when they were the two remaining viable candidates, but that Cruz was harder to book. Hannity is known as a hands-on kind of host, not leaving everything to his producers ID: 9586042 \nHannity is known as a hands-on kind of host, not leaving everything to his producers, and is known as being competitive about landing interviews. According to a Republican operative who has worked on campaigns that dealt with Hannity, Hannity calls candidates and their staff personally to book interviews. \n\u201cHe would call you personally and make it impossible to say no,\u201d the operative said. \n\u201cHe\u2019s competitive when it comes to this election and winning for the Republican Party,\u201d said the former Hannity producer. \u201cThat has always been at the root of his hard work, efforts. But Sean is also very talented and knows it\u2019s important to bring in ratings and be competitive on TV as well. If Trump was doing that \u2014 then he would make it a priority to have him on.\u201d \nHannity\u2019s gotten personally involved in key campaign moments. During the period in which Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, and Mike Pence were all vying to be Trump\u2019s running mate, Hannity was one of the key people pushing Gingrich. CNN reported that he flew Gingrich out to meet with Trump in Indiana before Trump made his final decision. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, right, and Fox News host Sean Hannity, talk off air. Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call,Inc. ID: 9586053 \nHannity\u2019s efforts to promote Trump have at times struck observers almost like a tacit job application. Rumors swirled during the Republican convention in Cleveland that Hannity had expressed interest in serving as White House chief of staff in the Trump administration. (Hannity denies these, saying he has never asked for a job with Trump. He also dismissed rumors that he might join some kind of future Trump media organization in the event Trump loses. Would he ever consider any sort of job with Trump? \u201cIf I had no money and no job,\u201d Hannity says, he\u2019d consider it.) And he has defended Trump privately, too; a source with knowledge of the incident told BuzzFeed News that in the Fox News greenroom in Cleveland, Hannity cornered Utah Sen. Mike Lee \u2014 a Trump critic who became one of the most prominent figures in the Free the Delegates movement at the convention \u2014 and berated him for not getting on board with Trump, telling Lee he needed to get over his ego. \n\u201cAt first it started out in a stern but friendly tone but it was enough that there were people who left the green room\u201d as the conversation became \u201cheated,\u201d the source said. \nHannity said he and Lee are \u201cfriends\u201d and that he didn\u2019t remember such an argument. \u201cI think maybe once we might have discussed [Lee\u2019s opposition to Trump] mildly or briefly but I don\u2019t remember where,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a negative word towards each other at all.\u201d \nThere\u2019s no doubt that in giving Trump such a major platform over the course of months, Hannity played a role in his ascendancy to the nomination (though the same could be said for a number of other figures in the cable news world). Hannity has a friendly relationship with Trump going back years (\u201cI do like Donald Trump\u2019s ties\u201d, he told GQ in 2011). And Trump is a ratings boon. These two factors \u2014 combined with the fact that Hannity\u2019s move to the 10 p.m. slot in 2013 put him at a disadvantage ratings-wise \u2014 have been viewed as a driving force behind Trump\u2019s omnipresence on Hannity\u2019s show. According to a source with direct knowledge of the conversation, Hannity called Trump after Trump made his initial Iowa appearance in January 2015, urging him to enter the presidential race. Hannity told BuzzFeed News he never urged Trump to get in the race. \u201cI\u2019m friends with Donald Trump, I talk to him, and I talk to every other candidate,\u201d Hannity said. \nBut that\u2019s not to say that Hannity has always favored Trump in this particular election, or that his motivation during that time was to help him succeed in the race. Last summer, Hannity held a panel on his show with two guests. The topic was the nascent primary campaign that summer, and particularly Trump, who at the time was still considered an entertaining anomaly by most of the media and political class. After the segment wrapped up, according to one of the guests on the panel, Hannity turned to his two guests to ask them if they thought Trump could win. Neither did \u2014 and nor did Hannity, who laughed about Trump\u2019s candidacy and said he didn\u2019t think he could win the nomination, referring to him as an \u201cidiot\u201d in over his head, according to one of the panelists who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Hannity says he never said any of this and described the anecdote as \u201ctotal bullshit,\u201d saying \u201cthose words never came out of my mouth.\u201d \nTimes, clearly, have changed. And not just in the campaign. Hannity\u2019s increased behind-the-scenes Trump advocacy has come at a time of extreme turmoil in his network. Hannity is seen as a loyalist of Roger Ailes, the Fox News boss ousted following revelations that he allegedly sexually harassed female employees at the network. Hannity called the allegations \u201call BS\u201d on Twitter \u2014 an assertion that hasn\u2019t aged well considering Fox settled with Gretchen Carlson, the first Ailes accuser, for $20 million. Ailes, for his part, is now advising Trump and assisting with debate preparations. \u201cI do think that he thinks he\u2019s under attack,\u201d a Fox News source said. ID: 9586033 \nHannity has been relatively tight-lipped in public about the drama at Fox, telling the Washington Post on Wednesday, that \u201cI have no comment about any of these topics involving the Fox News Channel and what\u2019s happened.\u201d But his public persona has become more conflict-driven over the past few months as his feuds with various other media and political figures have become increasingly aggressive. He\u2019s recently gotten in drawn-out public spats with CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter and with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bret Stephens \u2014 another prominent voice from the Murdoch media empire, whom Hannity referred to as a \u201cdumbass\u201d and an \u201casshole\u201d after Stephens called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s dumbest anchor.\u201d \n\u201cI do think that he thinks he\u2019s under attack,\u201d a Fox News source said. \nRecently, Hannity traded barbs with Glenn Beck, who has staunchly opposed Trump. \u201cGlenn Beck is like on a \u2014 it\u2019s a holy war for him at this point. I mean, he\u2019s off the rails attacking me every day,\u201d Hannity said on his show. Beck responded : \u201cDon\u2019t condemn him. Please. The pressure on this job, the pressure on him, is enormous. Enormous! I truly believe he is trying to do the right thing. We just strongly disagree.\u201d And earlier this week he got into a drawn-out Twitter fight with National Review\u2019s Jonah Goldberg. The spats don\u2019t bother him, he says. Asked if he\u2019s worried about burning bridges with former allies, Hannity dismissed the idea. \n\u201cBurning bridges? Who am I serving here? Am I going to live my life caring what people at WSJ and the NRO think of me?\u201d Hannity said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life caring how the punditry class thinks of you.\u201d \nHannity blasted Beck and others who still oppose Trump for their \u201cmysterious reluctance and sabotage\u201d and he partly blames them for the fact that Republicans have not fully unified behind Trump. Hannity calls them out for their \u201cconstant negativity towards Trump, who\u2019s offering you a pretty good vision.\u201d \nRegardless of whether Trump is offering a clear vision, or the vision is to your taste, Sean Hannity hasn\u2019t done much different. The outrage about Hannity\u2019s support of Trump from conservative figures didn\u2019t happen when Hannity was similarly supporting McCain or Romney. In a year where Republicans are more divided than ever, Hannity has become a symbol of that division and a flashpoint for anti-Trump frustrations. \n\u201cI think the reason you\u2019re seeing it\u2019s appearing he\u2019s going out of his way for Trump is you might not be taking into account that this is a unique election because the GOP is splintered in media, there\u2019s an anti-Trump faction in media,\u201d said AJ Delgado, a Trump surrogate and adviser who regularly goes on Hannity\u2019s show. \u201cNormally where you see the entire GOP pundit class behind one person, that\u2019s why Sean appears to stick out.\u201d \nDelgado said she never feels pressured to say anything on Hannity\u2019s show and that she appreciates how he hasn\u2019t pigeonholed her to just speak about Hispanic issues. As for the rumors of Trump TV, she dismissed them as \u201cjust rumors.\u201d \nHannity says he is under contract for both radio and TV until the end of 2020. He makes millions of dollars hosting his radio show, for which he signed a contract with Premiere Networks in 2013. It\u2019s for this reason that some dismiss out of hand the rumors that Hannity wants some kind of role with Trump in the future. But as speculation ramps up that Trump is building some kind of media organization for after the election, a possible future for Hannity could take shape. One Fox News host speculated to New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman that Hannity would join Trump\u2019s media outlet in a recent story. \u201cI have no idea where that mysterious story popped up from,\u201d Hannity says of Trump TV rumors, and he says no one in Trump\u2019s world has approached him about such a move. \nOn Tuesday, Greta Van Susteren announced she was leaving Fox News, taking advantage of a \u201ckey man\u201d clause in her contract that allowed her to leave in the event of Ailes leaving, which he has. In a statement, Van Susteren said that Fox no longer felt like home to her. It\u2019s believed that other big names at Fox, including Hannity, also have the key-man clause in their contracts. In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Hannity would not talk about details of his contract beyond its length. \nBut \u201cit would take a lot for him to leave,\u201d the former Hannity producer said, pointing out that Ailes is not the only higher-up Hannity is close with. Bill Shine, who is now in control of the network, was once his producer. \nSo Hannity may stay where right where he is \u2014 the same \u201ccheerful soldier,\u201d as one Fox News source put it, continuing to do the same work he\u2019s always done. It\u2019s the world that has shifted around him. \n\u201cAt the end of all this he\u2019ll still be cheerful,\u201d the source said, \u201cbut who knows what he\u2019ll believe.\u201d Rosie Gray is a reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, D.C.

A source said MGM was sympathetic and sought to be helpful on the issue, but did not want to open itself up to further legal issues from groups it has banned from passing out forms or soliciting on its properties in the past. \nIn an interview last week on registration efforts, Voto Latino\u2019s Maria Teresa Kumar said 100 to 150 people might register at each concert. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the results will be because it\u2019s the first time we\u2019re doing it,\u201d she said. \nWhile the dispute may seem minor, it caused considerable consternation among a group of Democrats who view the largest owner of casino sites in Nevada as a strong partner. The message from those Democrats and unions was clear: Don\u2019t piss off MGM. \n\u201cThey let us do GOTV, and park buses on their property,\u201d a source said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to drive their employees to early vote sites, we get thousands of Latinos to vote that way.\u201d \nA source close to Man\u00e1 said the band will continue to support Voto Latino and Hispanic voter registration efforts from the stage and noted that all other shows have gone off without a hitch but confirmed the policy had to be honored and worked around in Las Vegas. \nYvanna Cancela, political director for the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, which counts majority Latino membership, said MGM has always supported its efforts. \n\u201cMGM has a long history of working with our union to ensure members have access to all parts of the electoral process; from citizenship drives to early voting mobilization,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year has been no different.\u201d \nJim Murren, MGM Resorts International chairman and CEO, is a Republican who endorsed Clinton in a USA Today editorial, saying he disagreed with Trump on trade, and believed Clinton was best when it comes to embracing diversity and immigration. \nWhile both candidates would secure the border, Murren wrote, \u201cClinton is the only candidate who will continue to make America a welcoming home for legal immigrants from around the world.\u201d \nStill, skittish Nevada operatives really wanted MGM to know that having to work around one long-standing policy was not a problem for a company they feel has worked well with them. \n\u201cThey\u2019re the biggest owner of casino sites,\u201d an operative said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t drive culinary members and casino workers \u2014 if we can\u2019t do that, we might as well pack it up.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo   New York.

You can call it whatever the hell you want, they\u2019re gone,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe crime will stop - they are going home.\u201d \nIf his Hillary Clinton is elected, Trump warned the crowd, \u201cthe result will be millions of more illegal immigrants, thousands of more violent crimes and total chaos and lawlessness.\u201d \nHe also suggested his opponent, Hillary Clinton, would be among the deportees. \n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll be able to deport her,\u201d he said. \nAt the rally, Trump said previous attempts at immigration reform have failed because of self-interested politicians and special interests. \n\u201cWhen politicians talk about immigration reform, the usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages,\u201d Trump said. \u201cImmigration reform should mean something else entirely.\u201d \nLike he\u2019s done at previous rallies, Trump also listed crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in the US, and at the end of his speech inviting the relatives of victims of undocumented immigrants. \nThe speech has been a highly anticipated after the Republican nominee indicated he might be open to \u201csoftening\u201d his stance on immigration controls. He then later said he had not changed his mind on the strict proposals he promoted during his campaign. \nInstead, Trump said the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country would not be allowed to stay in the country legally unless they returned to their country of origin and begin the process legally. \n\u201cPeople will know that you can\u2019t just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized,\u201d he said. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d \nThe policy introduced by Trump Wednesday night was based on 10 points, which he outlined as building a border wall, detaining and deporting anyone trying to illegally cross the border, deporting undocumented criminal immigrants, blocking funding of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d rolling back protections offered to the children of immigrants brought at a young age, and vetting people trying to come to the US. \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so tough, and if someone comes in that\u2019s fine, but they\u2019re going to be good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cVery few will slip through the cracks, hopefully none.\u201d \nTrump has said he wants to build a force to deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. And a hallmark of his campaign has been his proposal to build a wall along the border and force Mexico to pay for it. \nAfter meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto on Wednesday, Trump said the two discussed the wall, but not the issue of who would pay for it. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that,\u201d Trump told reporters after the meeing. \nHowever, Pe\u00f1a Nieto tweeted that the issue was indeed discussed at the beginning of the hour-long meeting, and that he told Trump Mexico would not pay for it. \nTrump\u2019s campaign then issued a statement saying the two men \u201chold two different views on this issue.\u201d \nTrump also adopted a different tone in Phoenix than he did after meeting with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, telling a rowdy crowd of supporters in Phoenix that Mexico would pay for the wall. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay for the wall,\u201d Trump said. \nDespite past suggestions that Trump might consider some sort of immigration reform that would address millions of people living in the US, Trump appeared to put an end to that speculation. \n\u201cAll energies of the federal government and legislative process must be focused on immigration security,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the only conversation we should be having at this time.\u201d 4. ", "Rosie Gray / BuzzFeed News ID: 9592258 \nWASHINGTON \u2014 A year ago, the alt-right was a loosely connected group of white nationalists mostly communicating online via trolling and memes. It\u2019s still that, but now it has a logo and is holding press conferences right near the White House. \nThree white nationalist leaders \u2014 the National Policy Institute\u2019s Richard Spencer, VDare\u2019s Peter Brimelow, and American Renaissance founder Jared Taylor \u2014 held forth behind a lectern at the Willard Hotel on Friday afternoon next to an \u201cAR\u201d logo created by Spencer. The event was an attempt to capitalize on the heightened level of notoriety the group has achieved this year in tandem with the rise of Donald Trump, especially since HIllary Clinton mentioned them in a speech last month. It indicated that elements of the alt-right, nebulous as it is, seek to turn it into a more cohesive, professionalized movement. \n\u201cThe big challenge for the alt-right is professionalization,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cI understand people wanting to be anonymous but we\u2019ve got to get beyond that. We\u2019ve got to have professional organizations, professional people doing it, we\u2019ve got to amp up what we\u2019re already doing.\u201d \n\u201cWe can\u2019t be a Trump cheerleading squad,\u201d Spencer said, acknowledging that some in the alt-right had discussed changing their level of support for Trump this summer when he started to waver on immigration. \nSpencer says he \u201cwants to influence people,\u201d and cited the neoconservative movement as a \u201cmodel to be emulated,\u201d starting out small and growing to have \u201ctremendous impact.\u201d \nTaylor, for his part, said he does envision a future in which alt-right candidates are running for office. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why people in the alt right can\u2019t also run for office,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI think that will happen as well.\u201d \nThe alt-right \u2014 at least its more public-facing leaders like the three who held the press conference on Friday \u2014 has cultivated a kind of high-low aesthetic, delving into obscure political ideologies one moment and talking about \u201cdank memes\u201d the next. At one point during the press conference, Spencer described the Pepe frog meme as a \u201csmug frog. This is someone who\u2019s willing to speak the truth.\u201d \nBrimelow, Spencer, and Taylor say alt-right ideas are gaining momentum. And while it\u2019s certainly true that the movement has become more and more well-known, it\u2019s tough to imagine that a movement that delves into such questions as \u201cDid you realize that you could tell the races apart by [microbes] living in your mouth?\u201d (a question posed by Taylor at one point during the press conference) and that consists of an unquantifiable number of mostly anonymous people will gain mainstream legitimacy in the near future. \nThe kerfuffle over the press conference itself shows how far they have left to go in terms of the professionalization Spencer seeks. The three had originally tried to book a space at the National Press Club, before the club canceled their reservation. The organizers waited until shortly before the beginning of the press conference to announce where it would take place, at one point telling attendees to go to the Old Ebbitt Grill where they would be met by a man in a charcoal suit who would lead them to the exact location. \nThough Spencer created a logo for the movement, he insisted that he, Taylor, and Brimelow are not attempting to present themselves as the alt-right\u2019s leaders, instead describing them as \u201cthree important nodes in the alt right.\u201d Taylor noted that most in the alt-right prefer to be anonymous, and that they are among the few who are \u201cnot afraid to face the cameras\u201d for fear of social or professional repercussions. \nThe logo, Spencer said, is aesthetically influenced by his love of \u201csynthwave nostalgia\u201d and is meant to evoke what he described as the youthfulness and dynamism of the movement. The version shown at the press conference was in black and gold and printed out on a placard. In the original version displayed on the invitation to the event, the color scheme was done in blue and white, leading some on Twitter to compare the triangular white \u201cA\u201d to a Ku Klux Klan hood. \nThe press conference was billed as an explainer of the alt-right, but it was also focused on where the three men see things developing in the future, both politically and on a grander philosophical level. Brimelow sees the country breaking up geographically into different sections, while Spencer envisions a white ethno-state. But the matter of more immediate concern is still Trump\u2019s campaign, which while not a perfect vessel for the alt-right is as close as anything has come, culminating in Trump\u2019s hiring former Breitbart News chairman Steve Bannon, who has described Breitbart as \u201cplatform for the alt-right.\u201d Alt-right members sneer not just at the left but also at movement conservatives, viewing them as relics who sold out on the issue that matters most: race. Brimelow dismissed National Review , for example, as a \u201ccuckservative operation.\u201d \n\u201cCertainly we have been you could say riding his coattails,\u201d Spencer said of Trump. He acknowledged the alt-right\u2019s differences of opinion with Trump on policy but downplayed the importance of policies at all; \u201cit\u2019s about him,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about in a way projecting onto him our hopes and dreams.\u201d 2.", "Facebook: video.php ID: 9650073 \nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron became visibly emotional as he called for Britain to take in more child refugees, warning that the country is being seen as \u201cmean\u201d. \nAddressing his party\u2019s conference in Brighton on Tuesday, he recalled a trip to the Greek island of Lesbos last year when he helped refugees from a flimsy boat. \nHe told how an aid worker from New Zealand had shouted to him: \u201cStop handing out bottles of water and take some effing refugees.\u201d \n\u201cBecause that is how Britain is seen,\u201d Farron said. \u201cMean and not pulling its weight. And maybe that doesn\u2019t bother some people, but it bothers me. \n\u201cBecause I am proud of who we are \u2013 always a sanctuary for the desperate, the abused, and the persecuted. And I will not stand by and watch my country become smaller, meaner, and more selfish. That is not Britain. We are better than that.\u201d Gareth Fuller / PA ID: 9650095 \nFarron said the government had \u201cbarely lifted a finger\u201d to help tackle the refugee crisis since the newspapers had moved on from the death of 3-year-old Alan Kurdi last year. \nAnd yet the crisis was getting \u201cworse not better\u201d, he warned. \u201cMuch to the government\u2019s delight, compassion fatigue has set in, the news has moved on,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had Brexit, a new prime minister, a Labour leadership contest. And none of that makes a blind bit of difference to a 9-year-old kid stuck alone and hungry and cold in a camp in northern Greece.\u201cOr to the family this morning fleeing their burning camp in Moria. This government wants us to forget this crisis \u2013 it\u2019s too difficult to solve, too risky to take a lead. \n\u201cBut we have not forgotten, we will not forget. Those children could be our children. How dare the government abandon them.\u201d \nFarron\u2019s passionate speech was given a standing ovation by party activists.

Alex Wong / Getty Images ID: 9572575 \nWASHINGTON \u2014 What exactly is Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policy? \nCongressional Republicans are still unsure, or outright don\u2019t want to discuss their nominee\u2019s policy, days after Trump\u2019s major speech on the issue and weeks of uncertainty. \n\u201cAsk Trump about that,\u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama when asked about his understanding of Trump\u2019s position. Asked again, Shelby responded: \u201cI\u2019m supporting the ticket.\u201d \nIn recent weeks, Trump has toyed with taking a softer approach toward undocumented immigrants, taken a trip to Mexico, delivered a roaring immigration speech that matched the tone and substance of his campaign, and given a somewhat vague series of answers about what to do with the majority of undocumented immigrants inside the country. \nIt\u2019s left a degree of confusion about what the nominee\u2019s position really is on his signature issue. And, returning to Washington after a seven-week break, several GOP senators and representatives \u2014 those who have endorsed Trump and those who have not \u2014 gave varying responses when asked what their nominee\u2019s immigration position was. \nAlaska Sen. Dan Sullivan deferred to another topic. \u201cIf you want to ask me about my recess in Alaska, I was just home for seven weeks.\u201d \nA second question about immigration got the same response: \u201cAsk me about my recess in Alaska.\u201d \nColorado Sen. Cory Gardner, who recently said he was backing Trump after months of silence, talked about Hillary Clinton instead when asked about Trump\u2019s immigration plan. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a long ways between now and the election. I look forward to Hillary Clinton continuing to implode in front of the American people,\u201d he said. \nBut what did he make of Trump\u2019s immigration speech? Gardner referred further questions to his office. \nGeorgia Sen. Johnny Isakson said he shouldn\u2019t editorialize on Trump\u2019s immigration policy because he hasn\u2019t been paying too much attention to it. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been running my own race so I haven\u2019t been paying a lot of attention to his race,\u201d he said. \nSen. Tim Scott of South Carolina responded with a question. \u201cDid you ask Trump?\u201d \nWhen asked about his understanding of Trump\u2019s position, Scott said: \u201cI think the fact of the matter is that we have to have tighter enforcement overall and his plan\u2019s better than hers.\u201d \n\u201cI understand what\u2019s been published on his policy, I haven\u2019t done any\u2026a deeper dive into it.\u201d \nFlorida Rep. David Jolly, who isn\u2019t backing Trump, said: \u201cI have no idea. I haven\u2019t endorsed him, so I don\u2019t have to defend his position. But I have no idea what his position on immigration even is.\u201d \nSen. Lindsey Graham, who is also not supporting Trump, said at least one aspect of Trump\u2019s immigration plan was clear, although the details are still murky. \u201cI think he wants to build a wall \u2014 I got that part well,\u201d said Graham. \n\u201cI think he\u2019s having a hard time\u2026 I think it\u2019s an evolving position focused on border security, which I get. I think most Republicans want a plan for the 11 million. They don\u2019t want the crooks to stay but they don\u2019t want to break up the families. If Mr. Trump could articulate that that would help him.\u201d \nA few tried their best to sum up Trump\u2019s position. \n\u201cHe wants to take folks who\u2019ve committed a crime, ask them to leave or force them to leave, then he wants to secure the border. Once he\u2019s secured the border those who are still there would have some sort of, he implies, pathway to legal standing,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana. \n\u201cThat\u2019s in summary, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve studied it that much.\u201d \n\u201cHe wants legal immigration,\u201d said Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma. \u201cHe wants to be sure that if there are any who are here illegally that have any kind of a record or were accused of anything, that they should be expatriated and taken out, but he\u2019s still open to negotiating the families who\u2019ve been here for a long time [who] are gainfully employed. \n\u201cAnd so that part of his program\u2026doesn\u2019t really go beyond that that I know of.\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him,\u201d said Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana. \u201cI think what\u2019s clear is that he believes that those who are here illegally and those who break our laws additionally, that we\u2019re in this endless circle of sending those people who commit crimes to prison, we send them to their home country. And then they slip back through\u2026so he believes, and I agree with him, that we gotta stop doing that. And I agree that we need to have some sort of wall \u2014 whether it is a virtual wall.\u201d \nWhen pressed about how Trump would handle the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country, Fleming responded: \u201cAgain, I don\u2019t speak for him. I\u2019m just telling you what I think is the problem, and what my position is. I\u2019m not a surrogate for him.\u201d Tarini Parti is a Capitol Hill reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Washington, D.C. Contact Tarini Parti at .

Der Bunker , the directorial debut of Nikias Chryssos, is a heady dose of weirdness set almost entirely in the underground dwelling of the title, a place done up in the kind of mishmash vintage decor of people who haven\u2019t been keeping abreast of the times. The renter in question, who\u2019s never called anything other than \u201cthe student,\u201d is played by Pit Bukowski, and the fact that he stays after seeing his proposed lodging is a sign that he\u2019s just as off-kilter as his new roomies. \nThey\u2019re quite a bunch \u2014 the mother (Oona von Maydell) is convinced her leg is possessed by an alien visitor named Heinrich who sometimes weighs in with advice; the father (David Scheller) insists their child is going to be president of the United States, and won\u2019t hear otherwise; and then there\u2019s Klaus (Daniel Fripan), who claims to be 8 years old (Fripan\u2019s in his thirties) and is still being breastfed. Der Bunker would be an adequate piece of WTF-ery regardless of whether it added up to more. But it also works as a nightmare version of overprotective parenting. Klaus faces impossible expectations and extreme coddling at the same time, literally sheltered from the world in a surreal perma-childhood. \nHow to see it: Der Bunker is available on DVD and Blu-ray, and for digital rental/purchase via Vimeo .

Turns out, high school A-lister gone to seed is a good look for Pine, an actor who\u2019s game if not always that memorable in more traditional leading man roles. He makes all kind of sense as a guy whose life has failed to turn out as well as he once might have expected. Toby was the good kid, while his brother Tanner (Ben Foster) was the troublemaker, fresh out of jail when the film begins. Yet they\u2019ve ended up in the same place, broke and desperate, taking big risks to try to salvage something so that Toby\u2019s two sons don\u2019t end up in the same grinding poverty in which he finds himself stuck. \nMackenzie, whose last film was the terrific Jack O\u2019Connell prison drama Starred Up , is Scottish, and his screenwriter, Taylor Sheridan, is Texan; together, they create a portrait of an economically demolished area that feels lived in and allegorical all at once. Sheridan, an actor who made the shift to screenwriter with Sicario , fills out the space between tense bank robberies with chewy dialogue between the brothers and between Jeff Bridges and Gil Birmingham as the lawmen tracking the Howards down. Hell or High Water is the only wider release of the summer to touch on the white working-class despair that\u2019s become such a strong force in the current election, but it\u2019s also just tremendously entertaining, a cops and robbers story with no good guys or bad guys, a bunch of characters trying to get by. \nHow to see it: Hell of High Water expands to 900 theaters nationwide this week \u2014 search the list here . ID: 9515410 View this image \u203a Eric McNatt / Magnolia Pictures Filmmaker Ira Sachs\u2019 last movie Love Is Strange was a bright, sunny Manhattan horror story about how little time it takes for a longtime couple (John Lithgow and Alfred Molina) to go from stable homeowners to couch-surfers, testing the patience of friends, family, and each other after the loss of a job. Sachs\u2019 new feature, Little Men , is about a younger relationship being tested by the relentless forces of New York real estate \u2014 Jake (Theo Taplitz) and Tony (Michael Barbieri), teens whose friendship buds in the face of growing tension between their parents over the Brooklyn building they share. \nLittle Men is a discreetly barbed film about gentrification. Nestled within the initially polite \u2014 and later not-so-polite \u2014 negotiations between grown-ups Brian (Greg Kinnear), Kathy (Jennifer Ehle), and Leonor (Paulina Garc\u00eda) are all sorts of issues of race, class, and family ties. But it\u2019s also a story about the moment in which awareness of those and other dividing lines start encroaching on childhood. Jake and Tony enjoy the simple, easy rapport of two kids who just really like hanging out, but they\u2019re not going to stay children for much longer. The looming shadow of high school hangs over the connection between the introverted, possibly gay Jake and the pint-size swaggerer Tony, and they seem destined to be divided by social pressure no matter what their parents do. The fragility of their connection makes it all the more touching. \nHow to see it: Little Men is now playing in limited release \u2014 check out a list of locations here .

The two are, as his dad ruefully observes, \u201cthe only brothers\u201d in the quaint but far from diverse town, something Morris is reminded of by the unabashed, oblivious questions he gets about whether he\u2019s well-endowed, or good at basketball, or the owner of some pot that was found in the youth center. In between German lessons with his tutor Inka (Carla Juri), Morris writes hip-hop lyrics bragging about sexual feats he most definitely has not achieved. \nWhen he\u2019s befriended by the pretty, bored Katrin (Lina Keller) \u2014 at least at first for novelty value \u2014 heartbreak looms on the horizon for Morris. But Morris From America , directed by This Is Martin Bonner \u2019s Chad Hartigan, isn\u2019t interested in the expected beats, instead following Morris through a stage of growing up that\u2019s painful, poignant, and sweet. It\u2019s a movie that\u2019s especially strong when it comes to its father-son relationship, which is tested, at times, by the fact that Morris and Curtis have been left with each other as their default best friend. \nHow to see it: Morris From America is now in select theaters and is also available for digital rental/purchase.

He\u2019s a dude who, rather than give a woman his number, tosses her his actual phone and then peaces out, certain that\u2019ll guarantee they meet again. He\u2019s larger than life and terrifically, terrifyingly free, his behavior right on the border between fun and red flag. Tony (Emmanuelle Bercot) bets big on the former while ignoring the latter \u2014 in fact, she ends up marrying him. \nMy King , directed by French actor Ma\u00efwenn, is a nuanced portrait of a relationship that\u2019s equal parts emotional abuse and love \u2014 Georgio is erratic and energetic, devoted while also being a lying philanderer. He adores Tony and begs her to have a baby with him, only to move out while she\u2019s pregnant, claiming it\u2019s for the benefit of their romance. He\u2019s a gaslighter of masterful levels, but what makes My King so compelling \u2014 despite a tiresome, unnecessary framing device in which Tony rehabilitates an injured knee and, with it, a wounded spirit \u2014 is that it refuses to leave out the highs to only focus on the lows. The result is a film that shows why Georgio leaves, but also why Tony stays for as long as she does, returning again and again despite knowing better. \nHow to see it: My King is now in select theaters \u2014 check out a list of locations here .

The contrast between aesthetics and content at first feels jarring, then hypnotic, and finally, like the whole point of the film. As the main character Chris, played by onetime model Agyness Deyn, comes to realize, \u201cnothing endured but the land,\u201d and the people wresting a living out of it are mere flickers in comparison. The land\u2019s surpassing loveliness, captured in golden tones by cinematographer Michael McDonough, exists in indifference to the story being told. \nThat story\u2019s often a rough one, encompassing abuse, marital rape, and natural hardships, but it\u2019s broken up by periods of ebullient happiness. Chris grows up in the shadow of a domineering father (Peter Mullan, in the kind of role he can play in his sleep). When he falls ill and requires her care, Chris\u2019s dreams of becoming a teacher are over. After his death, she comes into her own, finally in control of the farm and her life, choosing for herself a sweet-faced local man named Ewan (Kevin Guthrie) to marry. When, in a cruel twist, World War I arrives, sweeping him up and returning him as violent and short-tempered as the parent from which she escaped, it\u2019s another in a line of heartbreaks for Chris. Deyn\u2019s subdued but luminous performance grows in resonance along with the character\u2019s strength, which, like the land Chris loves, is grounded in persistence. \nHow to see it: Sunset Song is available on Blu-ray and DVD, and for digital rental/purchase.

Having been granted political asylum in Norway, the gay Syrian man left his life in Istanbul, his home since June 2014, for a city he knew relatively nothing about in northern Europe. \nBoth men were caught between happiness and melancholy, knowing that making their relationship work long-distance would be hard; there was no news on Omar\u2019s resettlement application. \nSince same-sex partnership or marriage isn\u2019t legal in their homeland or in Turkey, despite being engaged the couple couldn\u2019t have their files with the UNHCR joined.

This brief flirtation with moderation led many to speculate that Trump was courting Hispanic voters \u2014 a theory that was buoyed by the candidate\u2019s last-minute meeting with the Mexican president Wednesday. \nBut interviews with a wide range of Republicans \u2014 from unabashed Trump supporters to #NeverTrump bitter-enders \u2014 suggested few in the party are still clinging to that hope. \nAri Fleischer, the former White House press secretary and a reluctant Trump supporter, praised the nominee\u2019s visit to Mexico, which he said made Trump \u201cappear more presidential\u201d and could help win over \u201ccollege-educated voters, a group with whom he\u2019s greatly underperforming.\u201d \nBut as for courting Latinos, Fleischer said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late. He likely has already made too many Hispanics think he doesn\u2019t want them in the country. They\u2019re not listening to his next sentence. He\u2019s already lost too much support that his words now won\u2019t make any meaningful difference.\u201d \nDavid Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican operative and former campaign strategist for Jeb Bush, interpreted Trump\u2019s immigration speech as a \u201cdecision to play directly to [his] already secured base.\u201d \n\u201cIt has to be their calculation that they can drive up turnout in white working-class areas of battleground states to dizzying heights,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cOtherwise this move makes no sense 69 days from the election.\u201d In any case, he added, \u201cThe \u2018softening\u2019 of Trump\u2019s immigration policy died tragically on Wednesday night in Phoenix. Foul play is suspected.\u201d \nRepublicans and conservatives remained sharply divided over the wisdom and effectiveness of Trump\u2019s immigration tough talk \u2014 but there was little disagreement about its intended audience. While right-wing Trump boosters like Ann Coulter celebrated on Twitter Wednesday night, several Hispanic campaign surrogates openly discussed rescinding their support for Trump. \n\u201cI thought a lot about union members, veterans, and moms in Rust Belt states and how they might be receiving this speech \u2026 I could easily visualize countless heads nodding \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d said Keith Appell, a conservative strategist who supports Trump. \nGreg Mueller, Appell\u2019s business partner and fellow Trump supporter, hailed Wednesday as \u201cone of the best days of [Trump\u2019s] campaign.\u201d \nCato Institute immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh, meanwhile, said, \u201cTrump\u2019s aim was to shore up his base \u2014 in late August. \u2026 The speech was one big dog whistle to anti-immigration populists.\u201d \nNowrasteh, who opposes Trump, added, \u201cAfter this speech, nobody can claim Trump has softened his policy. When he loses in November it will be because his immigration stance is wildly out of step with voters.\u201d McKay Coppins is a senior writer for the BuzzFeed News politics team, and the author of The Wilderness , about the battle over the future of the Republican Party.

Rick Santorum says Donald Trump\u2019s immigration position is one that he criticized his Republican primary opponents for taking. \nThe former senator, who ran against Trump before dropping out after a poor finish in the Iowa caucuses, said Trump shifted from calling for mass deportations to a position of uncertainty for undocumented immigrants. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit nuanced from where he was, for sure,\u201d Santorum said on the John Gibson Show on Friday. \u201cI mean, the fact is that he is not saying everybody has to go. He is saying he\u2019s going to set priorities and focus on criminal aliens as opposed to a broader path. I think if you look at the particulars, half of the people who are here illegally are here on visa overstays. He said those people have to go home, and we know who they are, we know how to track them, we have their names, we probably have locations for all of them. I think it\u2019s a matter of enforcement, so that takes care of half the problem.\u201d \n\u201cThen you\u2019ve got a big chunk of folks who are illegals, and I think the area where he is backed out a little bit is on what we\u2019re going to do with those who came here illegally in the first place and have not committed any crimes,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of left that question open. Yes, he did criticize people in the primary on that, but he\u2019s made a little bit of a shift in his policies. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with it, but that\u2019s the decision he\u2019s made.\u201d \nTrump said over the weekend that perhaps some undocumented immigrants could stay, but the Republican nominee has been sending mixed messages in recent weeks. \nSantorum added, \u201cWell, look, I think people who are in this country illegally should, unless you\u2019re in a job that is simply not being done\u2014and those are in the agricultural area. In those cases, I would provide for a work permit.

", "Joanne Carole / ASSOCIATED PRESS ID: 9625038 \nWASHINGTON \u2014 When Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign launched their DREAMer voter initiative titled \u201cMi Sue\u00f1o, Tu Voto\u201d (\u201cMy Dream, Your Vote\u201d), the lynchpin of the program was to mobilize undocumented youth who have often served as the face of the immigration movement, and use them to persuade neighbors and friends to vote because the DREAMers cannot. \nNow the campaign is looking to retrofit that idea for a crucial group of voters: Puerto Ricans in Orlando and along the I-4 corridor in the true swing state of Florida. The idea is to use residents on the island to connect with Floridians to impress upon them why they should vote, amid Puerto Rico\u2019s struggles with Zika and a financial crisis. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from Puerto Ricans that people on the island are dependent on those in Florida,\u201d said Latino vote director Lorella Praeli at a briefing ahead of Clinton\u2019s return to the trail after a case of pneumonia and a speech Thursday to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. She said the campaign is working on identifying leaders to help creating the initiative now for mobilization efforts. \nThe fight for Florida is intense, with polls showing the state as a toss up. There are more than a million Puerto Ricans in Florida; 1,000 relocate to the state from the island every month, U.S. citizenship in hand. The Clinton campaign has five offices in the Orlando area and three in areas with large Puerto Rican populations, in Kissimmee, Deltona, and south Orlando. On Sept. 24, the campaign will host its first caravana, a staple of Puerto Rican politics, featuring a procession of trucks, music, and bullhorns. \nBut there are challenges. While the campaign leans on the fact that Puerto Ricans on the island have high voter-participation rates, there is also a culture of voting in person, so the campaign not only has to get them to vote, but is also emphasizing early voting, which boosted Clinton during the primary. And as the Orlando Sentinel detailed in a recent report , 30% of Latinos in Orlando, Tampa and Central Florida reject party affiliation, \u201cwith only 68 percent of Latino adults in Central Florida registered to vote in their district, compared with 80 percent across the general, statewide population.\u201d \nDemocratic strategist Jose Parra, who is from Florida, said the key to the campaign\u2019s program to reach Puerto Ricans will be in the implementation because of every day realities that may take precedence over voting, presenting a challenge for the Clinton campaign trying to squeeze every drop of Latino votes out of the Sunshine state. \n\u201cYou have all these things Puerto Ricans are dealing with \u2014 there\u2019s a shortage of housing in central Florida because of the influx of people, rents are extremely high,\u201d Parra said. \u201cThey\u2019re living the immigrant experience, housing is expensive and it may not be close to work.\u201d \nBut the Clinton campaign won\u2019t be alone. Voto Latino, which is in the midst of a Hispanic Heritage Month voter registration push, recently launched a similar program to have celebrities and influencers in Puerto Rico call Florida residents to get them to vote. \nPraeli said the campaign will also be sending Puerto Rican supporters in New York to Pennsylvania to volunteer in the key state. \nClinton went to Puerto Rico in the Fall of 2015 for a roundtable on the island\u2019s health crisis \u2014 before Zika exploded in the national consciousness and recent reports that one in four residents will contract the disease, which can be deadly and is dangerous for pregnant women. \nShe recently went to Florida to address the issue, as the campaign\u2019s national political director Amanda Renteria has, when she visited the island to meet with officials to discuss the disease. Puerto Rico is also struggling through a financial crisis related to its debt and lobbied for bankruptcy protection before a financial control board was instituted by Congress. \n\u201cFolks know she has been with Puerto Rico in the crisis,\u201d Renteria said. \u201cWhile Trump believes in bankruptcies for himself \u2014 he has a hard time talking about how to help Puerto Ricans.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.

He used the song to show the dangers of allowing Syrian and other immigrants into the US, saying it will lead to homegrown terror attacks and be worse than the Trojan Horse. \n\u201cPeople are coming across our borders, people are coming into our country and we are going to make the Trojan Horse something that is unimportant,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis has to do with people coming into our country.\u201d Leticia Miranda/BuzzFeed News ID: 9645483 \nTrump\u2019s plan to crack down on immigration from certain regions of the world was met with roaring support by members of the crowd at the Germain Arena. \nBob Mercier, a 75-year-old from Punta Gorda, Florida, told BuzzFeed News that Trump has \u201cgot the right ideas.\u201d \n\u201cI do think the idea of vetting people coming in from areas where there is potential danger or an ideology that is against our beliefs in America is right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should help.

Indeed, your editor at Jacobin might ask you to soften it a bit. But Conard was among friends. Mitt Romney, his former partner, is the host of the E2 summit in Park City, Utah, at which he spoke; Meg Whitman was in the front row; Paul Ryan was waiting to give his own remarks. The question Conard raised \u2014\u201cwe might, as leaders of business and advocates of free enterprise, try to affect the political agenda\u201d\u2014 felt very pressing. \nThe remarks were also off the record. I heard them because I was a speaker at this year\u2019s gathering, and thus in the uncomfortable position for a reporter of not being able to report what I heard. But Conard likes to shock, and he has a book coming out \u2014 The Upside of Inequality \u2014 and after putting off an interview, he quietly put the speech on his website earlier this month, where you can watch or read the whole thing . (I\u2019ve posted that striking passage above.) \nConard, clad in a blazer and slacks and the ease that can be a marker of class, spoke from scrawled notes. His solution was \u2014 to the audience \u2014 hair-raisingly radical in its simplicity. It was a kind of roadmap for one future of the Republican Party, assuming the party (or at least the Wall Street wing of it) survives Trump. His plan requires replacing the religious right in the Republican coalition with the new populists, and mollifying them with new restrictions on trade and immigration \u2014 all in exchange for the holy grail of lower marginal tax rates. \nConard\u2019s argument starts with that fruitful relationship with the religious right. Worldly Republicans like the Utah crew have long compromised with religious conservatives many privately view as provincial crackpots, and Conard was describing the collapse of the Reagan coalition. It had been, as he said, remarkably productive: Huge cuts to marginal tax rates in exchange for lip service to a decades-long, failed effort to make abortion illegal. But it had also run its course: The tax rate, he noted, has \u201cgradually grown back to 43% as the demographics of that coalition have eroded.\u201d \nConard argued that capitalism needs new allies, and the new demographic would have to be the working class white voters leading the populist takeover of his party, a condition viewed in Utah with the pain and forbearance with which you talk about a close relative who has cancer. Conard called the disease \u201cTrumpism.\u201d At its heart, he said, was that workers have lost faith in the old Republican argument that closing a factory will, in the end, generate new jobs in other sectors for displaced workers. And Republicans, he said, need to realize that those new jobs won\u2019t come back to the Midwest \u2014 they\u2019ll move to Silicon Valley. \nCrucial to any new deal is that it \u201cleaves us \u2026 us being advocates of free enterprise, in control of the coalition.\u201d That is to say: That part of the deal is lower marginal tax rates. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t do us any good to be in the coalition if they are going to destroy free enterprise in the process and turn the Republican Party into what I think the Democratic Party already is,\u201d he said. \nAnd to replace religious conservatives in the Republican coalition with low-wage workers, he warned, would require a new set of \u201ctough, and perhaps even odious compromises.\u201d \nFirst, he said, the government would have to intervene in trade policy to force other countries to spend more of their savings on U.S. exports \u2014 a system he calls \u201cbalanced trade.\u201d In his new book, he lays out a system of import licenses to enforce this \u2014 a system, he admitted when he came by BuzzFeed in New York last week, many of his friends on the right will hate. \nThe second plan is, by the open market standards of the Wall Street Journal and the American business class, even more radical. \n\u201cUnfortunately, I think we have to dial down low-skilled immigration,\u201d he said. \u201cNo employer is going to go through the effort to employ hard-to-employ workers unless there\u2019s a shortage of labor, and there\u2019s not going to be a shortage of labor in a world where there is a near infinite supply of labor unless we create it. And, if we do create it, it\u2019s going to put pressure on employers to hire those workers and find jobs for them because they\u2019ll be the only workers left to hire.\u201d \nConard offered one bright lining to compensate: a dramatic increase \u2014 in immigration at the very high end. Say, 5 million new engineers and scientists and other groups of workers who are hard to find and expensive to pay. \nConard concluded by translating his proposal into \u201cvery easy\u201d political terms. \n\u201cWe should try to engineer a large increase in the most capable workers, [in exchange] for what the Democrats want which is a truce on low-skilled immigration\u201d\u2014 that is, a deal that lowers immigration in the future while legalizing poeple now here, he said. \nWould this be an acceptable deal to Democrats? It\u2019s not implausible. They speak on behalf of immigrants who are here and their families; they are less accountable to potential lottery winners in other countries. The new tension might be between the top 5% of workers \u2014 the microbiologists and engineers in Silicon Valley, who might see their wages fall \u2014 Conard acknowledged that was a \u201cconcern\u201d for them \u2014 if a boost for the venture capitalist employers. But he thinks that immigration could drive an explosion of growth \u2014 and the venture capitalists who employ them and want cheaper labor. And nobody weeps for software engineers. \nAnd then \u2014 is this how American politics really gets made? Genial bankers\u2019 secret speeches in rooms full of plutocrats? Or is this just a fantasy of the people who used to run the Republican Party? \nConard, for one, isn\u2019t sure. Nor, he told me, is he sure who he\u2019ll vote for in November.

It\u2019s part of what makes her a gifted public speaker: She\u2019ll charm you before she terrifies you. \nAnd Gabriel is, if nothing else, in the business of terrifying people. When she took the stage in Twin Falls, Idaho, in early August, it sounded like the opening track to a live rock album: \u201cHello, Idaho! I love you too!\u201d she yelled, while the crowd of nearly a thousand whooped and cheered. Then things got dark, fast. \n\u201cAll of us know something is not right with our country,\u201d she said. Gabriel is 51, with thick black hair and heavy-lidded eyes, and she speaks her staccato sentences with a slight Arabic accent. Part of what has entranced Gabriel\u2019s audiences over the years is that she looks and sounds, superficially, like the people she calls the enemy: She was born and raised a Maronite Christian in southern Lebanon, where, in her telling, radical Muslims destroyed her bucolic childhood at the onset of civil war in 1975. As a speaker and pundit, Gabriel bills herself as an expert on national security, a credential she bases partially on her experience as a \u201csurvivor of Islamic terror.\u201d In the Idaho town, population 47,468, she explained how the seeds of war were sown when Lebanon \u2014 multicultural, open-minded, misguided Lebanon \u2014 welcomed refugees from Palestine. A man in the crowd growled under his breath: \u201cScrewed yourselves.\u201d Brigitte Gabriel Courtesy ACT for America ID: 9693907 \nGabriel told of roving Islamists finding Christian families cowering in bomb shelters. \u201cThey would take the baby, tie one leg to the mother and another leg to the father, and pull the parents apart, splitting the child in half,\u201d she said. Someone groaned in disgust; people shifted in their seats. \u201cAs ugly and uncomfortable as these stories are, we must hear them to understand the barbarity that is coming our way.\u201d \nFor the audience that evening, this notion of \u201cbarbarity\u201d had recently become less of an abstraction. Gabriel was invited to Twin Falls by the local chapter of ACT for America \u2014 the grassroots organization she founded in 2007 \u2014 in the thick of the most heated political controversy to have visited the small agricultural city in decades. On June 2, two months before Gabriel\u2019s speech, three boys aged 7, 10, and 14, Muslim refugees from Iraq and Eritrea, were accused of sexually assaulting a 5-year-old girl in the laundry room of a low-income housing complex called the Fawnbrook Apartments. All were charged with felonies. In concert with a smattering of other groups, members of ACT for America launched a publicity campaign around the Fawnbrook case, accusing the local government of covering up the assault. (In truth, officials had sealed the case, as they would with any incident in which both victim and perpetrator are juveniles.) The story caught fire in the right-wing press, where it served as a shocking index of the dangers posed by Muslim refugees. \nIn Twin Falls, Gabriel laid out her conspiratorial vision: Refugee resettlement is one weapon in a vast scheme by radical Islam, led by the Muslim Brotherhood and with the complicity of the United Nations and the US government, to colonize and destroy America from within. \u201cYou think you are an isolated situation here in Twin Falls, Idaho. I am here to tell you that you are not alone,\u201d Gabriel said. \nAs she spoke, people in the audience shook their heads contemptuously in the direction of a row of empty seats near the front, which had been reserved for officials in the City Council and local law enforcement. None had shown up. \u201cShame on those who are covering up what happened to this little girl,\u201d Gabriel said, to huge applause. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourselves!\u201d In this Dec. 8, 2015 photo, Rick Martin, the head of the Committee to End the CSI Refugee Center, works to gather petition signatures in Twin Falls, Idaho. Otto Kitsinger / AP Photo ID: 9692284 \nMuch has been made of Donald Trump\u2019s ties to the far fringes of the American right. Nowhere is the connection more direct than with ACT for America, which is considered a hate group by organizations that track extremism \u2014 such as the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Center for New Community \u2014 and which has nevertheless contributed two board members, one former and one sitting, as national security advisers to the Trump campaign. The sitting board member is retired army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has become Trump\u2019s top military surrogate and who recently called Islam \u201ca cancer\u201d at an ACT chapter meeting. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.) \nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. From the early months of his campaign, Trump\u2019s positions on Islam and national security have drawn directly from the work of the anti-Islam lobby. This clique of activists and intellectuals preaches that violence and terror are inherent to Islam, and that \u201cevery practicing Muslim is a radical Muslim,\u201d as Brigitte Gabriel said in an interview in 2007. Trump, for instance, supported his first big pronouncement on Islam (that the US should ban Muslim immigrants from entering the country until we \u201cfigure out what is going on\u201d) by citing a specious poll produced by the Center for Security Policy, run by Frank Gaffney, another of the anti-Islam lobby\u2019s central figures. \nTrump\u2019s positions on Islam and national security have drawn directly from the work of the anti-Islam lobby.

Since 2007, following the model set in the 1990s by the Evangelical right, she has assiduously built a bona fide grassroots organization, mobilizing thousands of Americans around the premise that ordinary Muslims living among them constitute a covert threat. \u201cOur enemy is not an organization of people living overseas plotting to attack,\u201d Gabriel writes in her 2006 New York Times best-seller, Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America. \u201cOur enemies are the neighbors next door, the doctors practicing in our hospitals, and the workers who share our lunch break.\u201d \nWith ACT for America \u2014 often styled ACT! for America \u2014 Gabriel brought to the masses what was once a set of ideas confined to a cadre of conspiracy theorists in Washington, New York, and California. Today, the group has an annual budget of more than $1 million and claims 300,000 members in 1,000 chapters across the country. Even if these numbers are inflated or represent a largely idle membership, as some observers believe, the group has a substantial and dedicated core that has translated into political clout. The organization has recently taken to calling itself \u201cthe NRA of national security.\u201d Gabriel is reliably invited to comment on national television after every terrorist attack, including, most recently, an appearance on Fox News\u2019 The Kelly File in the wake of the bombings in New York and New Jersey. \n\u201cThey embody this idea that Islamophobia is not fringe,\u201d said Kalia Abiade, advocacy director for the Center for New Community, which monitors what it calls \u201corganized bigotry\u201d and has tracked ACT for America nearly since its inception. \u201cTheir positions might be extreme, but they are not a fringe movement. They have really good relationships with lawmakers. They\u2019ve got members of Congress speaking at their briefings. In terms of direct impact, I don\u2019t know who else would compete with them.\u201d \nGabriel dismisses her critics as naive and blinded by \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d She declined to be interviewed for this story, in keeping with her organization\u2019s general approach to the media. ACT for America\u2019s manual for local chapter founders, The Art of Chapter Leadership \u2014 an internal document that was not made public before now \u2014 has strict instructions never to give interviews that can be edited in any way. \u201cThe vast majority of \u2018stories\u2019 done on the subject of radical Islam and Sharia law are very unfriendly to the truth. The average reporter comes from a world view that fundamentally opposes ACT! for America\u2019s mission,\u201d the manual says . \u201cRarely will a media interview result in making a positive difference.\u201d \n\u201cPatriotism is not hatred, and we do not concern ourselves with the opinions of those who believe it is.\u201d ID: 9692564 \nGabriel did, however, provide written responses to a letter detailing the contents of this story, in which she said that she and her organization \u201cdo not consider ourselves anti-Islam. We are anti\u2013radical Islam and the political ideology behind terrorism.\u201d (In other contexts, Gabriel regularly conflates the two; in her 2008 book They Must Be Stopped , she writes of the roots of terrorism: \u201cIt\u2019s not radical Islam. It\u2019s what Islam is at its core.\u201d) \nGabriel also rejected the extremist label pinned on ACT for America by hate-tracking organizations. \u201cAd hominem attacks from anti-American groups such as these are as baseless as they are clich\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cPatriotism is not hatred, and we do not concern ourselves with the opinions of those who believe it is.\u201d Fawnbrook Apartments photographed in Twin Falls, Idaho on Sept. 20th, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9691994 \nWhat happened at the Fawnbrook Apartments \u2014 a complex of two-story clapboard buildings arranged around courtyards and parking lots in northern Twin Falls \u2014 has been the subject of such furious debate that it\u2019s difficult to disentangle fact from rumor. This is what we know: \nSometime around 5 p.m. on Thursday, June 2, an elderly Fawnbrook resident found three boys in a laundry room with a 5-year-old girl, who is white. Two of the boys, ages 10 and 14, belong to an Eritrean family that was resettled in Twin Falls from a refugee camp in Sudan. The third boy, age 7, belongs to a family of Iraqi refugees. \nInside the laundry room, the 7-year-old boy allegedly touched the girl in ways that included genital-to-oral contact. Officials investigating the case believe the 10-year-old may have touched the girl as well. At least one boy allegedly urinated on the girl. The 14-year-old allegedly took video with a mobile phone. \nThe first 911 call came at 5:20 p.m. Craig Kingsbury, the Twin Falls chief of police, told me that dispatchers interpreted that first report as a \u201cbullying-type call\u201d\u2014 an incident where a child had been mistreated but which did not necessarily rise to the level of a crime. Dispatchers confirmed the child was safe in the care of her family. A second call came 20 minutes later, this time clearly reporting a sexual assault. Paramedics and deputies from the Twin Falls Sheriff\u2019s Department arrived 26 minutes later. Officers and detectives from the Twin Falls Police Department were on scene shortly afterward. Felony charges were filed against all three boys, with maximum sentences of imprisonment until the age of 21; the prosecution is ongoing. \nA rumor circulated after the incident that police had taken more than two hours to arrive at Fawnbrook. This notion \u2014 and the often futile attempts by officials to dispel it \u2014 was one indication that the case was quickly becoming a magnet for speculation and mistrust. On June 13, a group of activists attended a meeting of the Twin Falls City Council to demand answers. Among them were members of the local chapter of ACT for America, including its founder, Julie Ruf, a 49-year-old resident of Twin Falls County. \nNo one on the City Council had heard about the reported crime at Fawnbrook. At that point, only one brief news item had appeared on a local TV station; moreover, the council has no jurisdiction over criminal matters, and law enforcement had seen no reason to brief it on the incident, one of about 30 cases of sexual assault against children in Twin Falls this year. \u201cIt caught us flat-footed,\u201d said Shawn Barigar, the mayor of Twin Falls. \u201cWe had no response.\u201d \nThe accusations came right away. \u201cI think there\u2019s a method of cover-up here in the community, and I think it starts with the police department,\u201d said Terrence Edwards, a member of the local ACT chapter. \n\u201cISIS is here,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood is here. There\u2019s been violations already occurred by Muslims here.\u201d \nThe story went viral on the conservative web. ID: 9692575 \nSoon after, a right-wing website called BehindMyBack.org published an ostensible account of the incident from an anonymous Twin Falls resident, who claimed to know several new details: The attackers were Syrian; they held a knife to the girl\u2019s throat before dragging her into the laundry room, where they \u201cgang raped\u201d her; the father of one of the boys, on finding out about the assault, high-fived his son. \nThe story went viral on the conservative web \u2014 Michelle Malkin published a piece titled \u201cHorror and Hush-Up in Twin Falls, Idaho\u201d praising the \u201crighteous citizen rebellion\u201d of ACT and other activists \u2014 and local officials went into damage-control mode. At the next City Council meeting, on June 20, Chief Kingsbury addressed the chambers in full uniform. All three boys had been charged with serious felonies, he said, and although the case was sealed by law, he could reassure the public that many of the details being reported were either provably false or unsubstantiated by any evidence. Twin Falls has no Syrian refugees. Police did not take two hours to respond. There was no evidence of a knife or a high-five. Kingsbury took a brief detour to dismiss another allegation: The buildings department had not, in fact, covertly expedited the local Islamic Center\u2019s permit for the construction of a new mosque. \nGrant Loebs, the chief criminal prosecutor for Twin Falls County, released a statement that similarly denied the rumors around the case. This only helped to fan the flames. Every official correction or denial was seen either as evidence of a cover-up or, at minimum, a sign that the government was trying to downplay the significance of what had occurred, and the local press was now considered just as culpable. Activists said it didn\u2019t matter that the accused weren\u2019t Syrian; what mattered was that they were refugees from countries with large Muslim populations. Local officials started receiving threats. One voicemail promised to send someone to the mayor\u2019s house to sodomize his wife and children, while another praised the murder of British member of Parliament Jo Cox, who was killed in June partly for her positions in favor of admitting refugees. \nAll the while, anti-refugee activists, led by ACT\u2019s chapter founder Julie Ruf, cultivated a relationship with the mother of the 5-year-old girl. They raised funds to move the family out of Fawnbrook. One Twin Falls resident bought them a car. Other than text messages exchanged with Michelle Goldberg of Slate , the alleged victim\u2019s mother gave interviews only to the right-wing press. When I visited the family\u2019s home in August, a couple who publish a Tea Party\u2013affiliated blog in northern Idaho came to the door; they declined to let me speak with the girl\u2019s mother. \nFor all the activists\u2019 claims that they were seeking justice and protection for the family, their actions sometimes had the opposite effect. Twice over the summer, activists organizing fundraisers or rallies for the girl released the family\u2019s identifying information on social media. Loebs, the county prosecutor, said he felt this crossed a line. \u201cAs a result of this, everybody\u2019s going to know who she is and what she\u2019s gone through,\u201d he said. \nThe coalition mobilizing around the Fawnbrook case was not limited to ACT for America \u2014 it included a handful of gun rights, libertarian, and other groups from the Magic Valley, as the stretch of southern Idaho around Twin Falls is known. Nevertheless, the accusations they leveled at local government had their unmistakable origin in the teachings of Gabriel and the anti-Islam lobby. At a City Council meeting on July 11, Ruf invited every member of the council to go see Gabriel speak at the high school auditorium. \u201cI believe you need to be informed,\u201d she said. Julie Ruf and \u201cWe the People Magic Valley\u201d hold a press conference in City Park in Twin Falls, ID after a speech by Brigitte Gabriel the night before. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692218 \nBrigitte Gabriel was born Hanan Qahwaji in 1964 in Marjayoun, a picturesque mountain town on Lebanon\u2019s southern border with Israel. Her arrival in the world, as she writes in Because They Hate , was destiny. Her mother, having been married and childless for 20 years, assumed she was barren, until one day in her mid-fifties she experienced symptoms of pregnancy. \u201cI always knew there would be a special meaning and purpose for my life,\u201d Gabriel writes. She describes her first decade as an idyll: Her parents were affluent and doting, and they lived in a \u201cmajestic two-story stone house \u2026 set into the side of a hill and surrounded by beautiful gardens of fruit trees and flowers.\u201d \n\u201cAll that came to an end when a religious war, declared by the Muslims against the Christians \u2026 tore my country and my life apart,\u201d Gabriel writes. In 1975, according to her account, a Palestinian militia bombed a military facility near Marjayoun, destroying her childhood home. Thus began the tribulations that Gabriel credits with shaping her worldview and that she describes, sometimes with varying details, in her books, speeches, and promotional materials. She was injured in the blast and spent days in the hospital, where her father explained the catastrophe by saying that \u201cthe Muslims\u201d wanted them dead because they were Christian \u201cinfidels.\u201d Over the next seven years, Gabriel and her parents lived in a cramped underground bomb shelter, subsisting on dandelions and grass. \u201cTo get some water, we would crawl under snipers\u2019 bullets to a nearby spring,\u201d she told her audience in Twin Falls. \nOver the years, many observers have taken issue with elements of Gabriel\u2019s autobiography. ID: 9692583 \nHer saviors, Gabriel writes, were the Israelis, who invaded and occupied Lebanon in 1982. After her mother was injured and ended up in an Israeli hospital, Gabriel was amazed to find that doctors were treating Muslim people, their enemies. The Muslim patients, she writes, were not so noble, including a woman who would say to the doctors \u201cwith an evil, hate-filled look on her face, \u2018I hate you all. I wish you were all dead.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cAnd for the first time in my life I saw evil,\u201d Gabriel writes. \u201cI realized that this Muslim couldn\u2019t love the Jews even after they had saved her life. And when you are unable to be grateful to the people who saved your life, you have no soul.\u201d \nOver the years, many observers have taken issue with elements of Gabriel\u2019s autobiography. In his book The Islamophobia Industry , Nathan Lean calls her origin story \u201ctendentious if not outright deceitful.\u201d There is, to begin with, her characterization of the Lebanese civil war as a plainly religious conflict started by Muslims out of hatred for Christians and Jews. \u201cHer narrative is not historically accurate,\u201d said Yvonne Haddad, a historian at Georgetown University. Like Gabriel, Haddad is an Arab Christian \u2014 she was born in Syria and lived in Lebanon for four years. Unlike Gabriel, when Haddad looks at the Lebanese civil war, she (along with most scholars) sees a conflict with an elaborate cocktail of sociopolitical causes, in which religion is only one ingredient. Even the major player in what Gabriel describes as the radical Muslim side, the Palestine Liberation Organization, was composed mainly of secular socialist blocs. facebook.com ID: 9692251 \nIn 2008, an American lawyer and journalist named Franklin Lamb published an article in the weekly magazine of Al-Ahram , Egypt\u2019s state-owned newspaper, that included interviews with some of Gabriel\u2019s former neighbors in Marjayoun. These neighbors, Lamb wrote, \u201csay she may have spent a few nights in her home\u2019s shelter at times, or more likely in her basement, as did many in Marjayoun, but to their knowledge Brigitte lived fairly normally in her family home.\u201d Others have pointed out that Gabriel\u2019s depiction of Marjayoun as perpetually besieged by snipers and shells, requiring her family to live for years on weeds and grass, requires some embellishment; the Lebanese civil war, like many conflicts, consisted of stretches of calm punctured by violence. (In the statement she provided for this story, Gabriel accused Lamb of fabricating his interviews and otherwise dismissed her skeptics. \u201cI have my reality,\u201d she said.) \nTwo years after the Israeli invasion, in 1984, Gabriel moved to Jerusalem and took a job at Middle East Television, a news station owned by the Christian Broadcasting Network, itself owned by the famous American televangelist Pat Robertson. As an evening news anchor, she adopted the name Nour Saman \u2014 the first of two name changes in her career. (Gabriel says that everyone at the network had a pseudonym for security reasons.) In the contrast between Jerusalem\u2019s eastern and western halves, Gabriel writes, she saw a perfect illustration of \u201cthe differences between Arabic and Jewish culture\u201d: Whereas the Israeli side was clean and organized and planted with flowers, the Arabic side was perpetually squalid. \u201cIn my six years living in Jerusalem I never once saw an Arab man sitting with a book in his hand,\u201d Gabriel writes. \u201cThe difference between the two cultures has nothing to do with money, and everything to do with values. It is truly the clash of civilizations in its rawest form.\u201d \nDuring her tenure at Middle East Television, Gabriel met Charles Tudor, an American working for the network as a camera operator. The two married and, in 1989, moved to the US and settled in Virginia Beach, where the Christian Broadcasting Network is headquartered and where, according to public records, they still live. Years later, on Sept. 11, 2001, while watching the twin towers fall on TV, Gabriel writes, \u201cI was struck by the same fear that I experienced during the war in Lebanon. As I watched, words instinctively came from my mouth as I spoke to the TV screen: \u2018Now they are here.\u2019\u201d College of Southern Idaho Refugee Center director Zeze Rwasama (far left) talks with staff member Yvonne Ray (center) at the center\u2019s office in Twin Falls, ID on Sept. 20, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692090 \nThe Snake River Canyon, which runs along the northern edge of Twin Falls, is deep and broad enough to confuse one\u2019s sense of scale. From the rusted steel bridge that traverses the canyon, objects seem at once impossibly distant and perfectly clear. This gives a charmed quality, like a living children\u2019s book illustration, to what would otherwise be a humdrum town. The effect is heightened by the fact that Twin Falls, unlike many small cities in Middle America, does not give the impression of being in trouble; absent, for the most part, are shuttered businesses, homeless people, or buildings in decay. \nThe federal government has been bringing refugees to Twin Falls since 1980. The resettlement program, based out of the College of Southern Idaho, is run by Zeze Rwasama, who is himself a refugee, having been displaced from what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the chaos that followed the Rwandan genocide. When he arrived in Idaho in 2014, Rwasama said, the refugee center was operating quietly, with little to no controversy, as it had for three decades. Unusually low unemployment and comparatively high demand for agricultural labor made the Magic Valley region better equipped than most, he said, to accommodate a steady influx of refugees. The Snake River Canyon in Twin Falls, ID photographed on August 5th, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9694892 \nWhen I met him in his undecorated office in Twin Falls, Rwasama was wearing elaborate, pointy cowboy boots under jeans. Even though his department was a prime target of the anti-refugee movement, he had been watching the uproar with a sort of quiet bemusement. \u201cYou know, even when I was in Africa, I worked with refugees,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this issue of anti-refugee\u2026 it happens everywhere. It comes with being a stranger in a new country \u2014 people feel like, why are we helping them? Why aren\u2019t we helping our own people that are suffering?\u201d \nRecently, though, Rwasama has begun to worry that the growing tension might do lasting damage to the community. I had arrived in Twin Falls expecting to hear about friction between locals and refugees, particularly Muslims, and I assumed this is what Rwasama was talking about. But he corrected me: Although there had been instances of public hostility toward refugees, the newcomers, by and large, were too busy coping with their transition into American life to register much of a day-to-day difference. \u201cIt\u2019s not between the refugees and the local community,\u201d Rwasama said. \u201cIt\u2019s between them \u2014 the local people that are for and against.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not between the refugees and the local community,\u201d Rwasama said. \u201cIt\u2019s between them \u2014 the local people that are for and against.\u201d ID: 9692590 \nIt wasn\u2019t refugees, then, who were most caught off-balance by the acrimony surrounding the Fawnbrook case. It was the institutions \u2014 law enforcement, the City Council, the local press \u2014 that had grown used to operating in a political atmosphere that was civil and trusting. I met with Suzanne Hawkins, a City Council member who is now the city\u2019s vice mayor, in a soda shop with framed covers of the Saturday Evening Post on the walls. With a vaguely shell-shocked air, she told me how the events of the previous two months had rattled her otherwise uneventful career in public service. Like other local officials, Hawkins received many vivid threats after the Fawnbrook case hit the national right-wing press. \nHawkins stressed that she is devoutly Christian, and that the average American would recognize her as a committed conservative in a deep red state. In fact, she sympathizes strongly with the unease many people feel over the arrival of Syrian refugees. \u201cAs an American, I understand being afraid,\u201d she said. \nSo it was especially distressful when anti-refugee activists started showing up at council meetings claiming that Hawkins and her colleagues were covering up the rape of a small child to protect Muslim refugees. Even the less damning accusations were so off base as to be exasperating, like the claim that the city had secretly expedited a building permit for the local mosque. \nWorse, some of the accusers were people Hawkins knew personally, including Julie Ruf. A few years back, when a group of homeschool students that included Ruf\u2019s son got their high school diplomas, the parents asked Hawkins to speak at the graduation. \u201cThey had that much faith in my beliefs, right?\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cSo, to go from there to a point where she\u2019s accusing me of things that anybody who knows me has to know aren\u2019t possible \u2014 what happened?\u201d View this image \u203a Twin Falls vice mayor Suzanne Hawkins attends a luncheon and information session at the College of Southern Idaho put on by the city\u2019s chamber of commerce for government officials in Twin Falls, ID on Sept. 20th, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692221 \nThe coalition that invited Brigitte Gabriel to Twin Falls, which calls itself We the People Magic Valley, includes the local chapter of the John Birch Society. The Birchers, as they were dubbed, emerged from the anti-communist hysteria of the late 1950s. It was partly their rise in the Goldwater 1960s that prompted historian Richard Hofstadter to write \u201c The Paranoid Style in American Politics \u201d for Harper\u2019s , in 1964. One of Hofstadter\u2019s insights was that paranoid groups did not usually create their conspiracy theories out of whole cloth; more often than not, they built them on a series of carefully selected facts. \nAbout halfway through her appearance in Twin Falls, Gabriel unveiled one of the most crowd-pleasing elements of her typical speech. Holding up a stack of papers, she read the title quickly in her native Arabic, then asked, to laughter, \u201cYou all got that?\u201d The document, she explained, was the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s secret \u201cplan for the destruction of the United States.\u201d In great detail, it outlines how the Brotherhood would perform \u201ccivilization jihad\u201d in America, infiltrating its political and civic institutions to set the stage for a final coup \u2014\u201cdestroying the Western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands,\u201d Gabriel read. \nThe document Gabriel was holding is real. It was uncovered during the 2007 trial of the Holy Land Foundation, an American pro-Palestine group convicted of financing terrorism. The \u201cExplanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America,\u201d as it is officially titled, was written in 1991 by a man named Mohamed Akram, who presented it to the Muslim Brotherhood council. It is, in essence, an aspirational document , in which Akram beseeches the Brotherhood to consider what he called his \u201chopes, ambitions and challenges.\u201d \nThere is no evidence that the Brotherhood paid attention to Akram\u2019s entreaties. In other words, the fact that a functionary in a sprawling organization envisioned an elaborate plan 25 years ago does not mean that the plan has been put into place, much less successfully. And yet, for the anti-Islam lobby, these 15 pages are a smoking gun, cited constantly as proof that America is falling victim to a meticulously orchestrated plot. \nThe paranoid style has characterized Gabriel\u2019s work since her first years of activity in the United States. In the years after 9/11, she began making a name for herself as a national security speaker and pundit, drawing on her experience of the Lebanese civil war and her work as a journalist in the Middle East. Her first two books, Because They Hate , published in 2006, and They Must Be Stopped , in 2008, describe an epic clash between Islam and the West in which no less than the survival of our civilization is at stake. The books made Gabriel a star attraction on the Evangelical and Zionist speaking circuits. By then, she had already founded an educational nonprofit, the American Congress for Truth. But, as Gabriel often says, she had grown tired of talking and decided to start acting. \nACT for America originated as the lobbying arm of Gabriel\u2019s existing nonprofit. Its first executive director was Guy Rodgers, who, at 52, was an unsung hero of the religious right. From 1991 to 1994, Rodgers worked as the national field director for the Christian Coalition, the grassroots organization started by Pat Robertson (the televangelist who owned the station where Gabriel worked in the Middle East). The Christian Coalition played a defining role in American politics in the 1990s and beyond, helping Newt Gingrich launch his historic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1994 and turning socially conservative Evangelicals into the critical Republican voting bloc they are today. \nWith ACT for America, Rodgers applied the Christian Coalition\u2019s fieldwork model to Gabriel\u2019s project. That was Gabriel\u2019s innovation: teaching ordinary people across America that the threat of global jihad is not just the possibility of an occasional terrorist attack \u2014 it\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now, down the street. ACT\u2019s internal manual for chapter founders instructs members to begin their work by \u201cmapping\u201d their local communities, paying special attention to mosques and madrassas . It also suggests that members sign up for courses at their local universities in political science and Middle East studies, as \u201c[t]hese two departments have a real likelihood of being funded by the Saudis.\u201d \nWith Rodgers at the helm, ACT for America\u2019s membership grew from 50,000 in 2008 to 240,000 in 2012, according to tax records. As its influence expanded, the group began to perform a critical function for the anti-Islam lobby. In its early years, ACT for America\u2019s chief project was helping to enact legislation supposedly designed to keep so-called Sharia law out of American courts. The notion of \u201ccreeping Sharia\u201d\u2014 which holds that Muslims are subverting the legal system to supplant it with Islamic law \u2014 was largely the brainchild of Frank Gaffney, of the Center for Security Policy, and David Yerushalmi, a lawyer in the anti-Islam lobby\u2019s inner circle. While Gaffney and Yerushalmi supplied the conspiracy theories and legal language for anti-Sharia bills, ACT supplied the ground troops necessary to pressure state legislators into passing them. \nTo meet constitutional standards, most of these bills couldn\u2019t explicitly refer to Sharia; instead, they sought to prohibit \u201cforeign law\u201d generally. By 2015, 10 states had passed such bills, effectively legitimizing what had until then been a generally derided, fringe cause. Today, creeping Sharia turns up regularly in mainstream political contexts, including Donald Trump\u2019s proposed plan for \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants, which would bar those who \u201cbelieve Sharia law should supplant American law.\u201d People line up outside of the Twin Falls High School auditorium to hear Brigitte Gabriel speak on August 4th, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692107 \nThere is some disagreement among Gabriel\u2019s critics and observers over whether her passions are sincere or whether she is simply cashing in on public fears. Yvonne Haddad, the history professor at Georgetown, classifies Gabriel as part of a group she calls \u201cthe native informants\u201d: former Muslims or people from the Middle East, Haddad said, \u201cwho have made millions of dollars by saying, \u2018I know them because I\u2019m one of them. I know what they\u2019re scheming for you. Give me money and I\u2019ll tell you some more.\u2019\u201d \nRegardless of her motivations, Gabriel\u2019s work has proved lucrative. In the years leading up to 2012, as ACT for America grew its membership under Guy Rodgers, Gabriel gradually increased her salary from both of her nonprofits, according to tax filings. Between 2010 and 2011, her salary from ACT for America went from $87,300 to $156,473 \u2014 an increase of more than 79%. In 2011 and 2012, tax records show, ACT for America made additional payments to Gabriel as the owner of a consulting firm, and to Gabriel and her husband as co-owners of a video production company; in 2011, these payments were in excess of $300,000. \nIn the written statement she provided for this story, Gabriel said the salary jump between 2010 and 2011 was an emergency measure to pay for her and her family\u2019s relocation, after the Tennessean published her real name. \u201cAs a result, my family received information from the authorities that my address, and the names of my husband and children were posted 160,000 times on Islamic websites,\u201d she wrote. (Gabriel\u2019s real name is listed on publicly available tax documents for her nonprofits.) \nGabriel\u2019s salary from ACT for America dropped in 2012, but still remained about 50% higher than it had been before it jumped. All told, Gabriel made $223,809 that year from her nonprofits, plus an additional $237,804 in payments to firms she controlled. Around this time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations released a report on what it called the \u201cIslamophobia network,\u201d which included information about executive compensation in key organizations and highlighted Gabriel\u2019s raises. The report caused a small stir inside the anti-Islam lobby. David Gaubatz, who had become a darling of the group when he wrote Muslim Mafia , a book about CAIR, announced his retirement in an email to his supporters that denounced unnamed nonprofits as \u201cbusiness corporations fighting for the big bucks.\u201d \nIn the next tax return that ACT for America filed after the publication of CAIR\u2019s report, Gabriel\u2019s salary dropped to $0. According to the returns, ACT for America continued making payments to Gabriel as a consultant, as well as to the video production company she owned with her husband. The same year, according to public records, Gabriel formed a company, incorporated in Nevada, called Bahia, Inc. (There is no public indication of the company\u2019s purpose.) Throughout this time, ACT\u2019s fundraising remained steady \u2014 in 2013, the latest year for which there is an available tax return, their total revenue was $1.17 million, about the same as the prior four years. \nAlong with money has come political influence. Early in September, ACT for America held its sixth annual conference in Washington, D.C. The conference drew 10 members of Congress, including Ted Cruz. (Six others canceled appearances under pressure from activists.) Materials distributed during the conference included a detailed guide on how to lobby on Capitol Hill and a list of 20 congressional bills that ACT is involved in promoting. \nNathan Lean, author of The Islamophobia Industry , said the documents showed how much ACT for America has progressed. In its early years, ACT\u2019s efforts were directed almost entirely at the states, and the group\u2019s presence on Capitol Hill was small; now it appears to be shifting more of its attention to the national level, and is doing so more clearly as a part of the larger, coordinated political project of the religious right. \n\u201cNobody has a base like they do.\u201d ID: 9693311 \nThe presidential campaign has been a factor. On February 28, ACT for America posted a photo to Facebook and Twitter of Gabriel and Trump together in Mar-a-Lago, the candidate\u2019s estate in Florida. Three weeks later, Walid Phares, who previously sat on ACT\u2019s board of directors, joined the Trump campaign as a national security adviser. Like Gabriel, Phares is a Maronite Christian from Lebanon. \nThen, in March, Trump picked Michael Flynn, the retired army general and sitting member of ACT\u2019s board, as his top military adviser. In high-profile public appearances, Flynn generally limits his comments about Islam (as opposed to, say, terrorism or national security), but he nevertheless toes the ACT line. Last month, he addressed an ACT chapter meeting in Dallas, where, as the Morning News reported , he likened Islam to \u201ca cancer.\u201d He also warned of the dangers of creeping Sharia in Texas and said Islam is \u201ca political ideology\u201d that \u201chides behind being a religion.\u201d \nKalia Abiade, of the Center for New Community, recalled watching with amazement as Flynn gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in July. From the beginning, Abiade said, her group has considered ACT for America to be in a special category compared with other players in the anti-Islam lobby. \u201cNobody has a base like they do,\u201d she said. But this \u2014 a sitting board member for an organization that the center considers a hate group, onstage at the nomination of a Republican presidential candidate \u2014 was new. \u201cThis is all sort of surreal to us,\u201d she said. \nNearing the end of her speech in Twin Falls, Gabriel delivered one of her biggest applause lines: \u201cWe are hoping that by the time we have a president next year, that he \u201d\u2014 loud cheers \u2014\u201cwill be so strong that he will put a complete stop to this baloney and make America great again!\u201d After the speech, I overheard a Breitbart reporter tell Ruf, the ACT chapter leader, to please deliver a message to Gabriel: \u201cTell her that Steve Bannon says hello.\u201d Less than two weeks later, Bannon, Breitbart\u2019s CEO, was named chairman of the Trump campaign. Imad Eujayl chats with fellow worshipers after delivering the sermon during an afternoon prayer service at the Twin Falls Islamic Center in Twin Falls, ID., August 5, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692117 \nIn the days after the Fawnbrook case hit the news, Imad Eujayl realized that he knew the Eritrean family whose two boys were allegedly involved. Eujayl is one of the rare African immigrants in the Magic Valley who did not arrive first as a refugee; originally from Sudan, he works as a molecular biologist for the US Department of Agriculture and acts as a spokesperson for the local Islamic Center. Eujayl went to the Fawnbrook Apartments to see the Eritrean family and found them sitting on their living room floor. \nThe two boys had been arrested and were still in custody. \u201cBack in their culture, when someone dies, you don\u2019t sit on the chairs and the beds and be comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou show your sadness by sitting on the floor. And this was a tragic thing.\u201d The two boys had grown up in refugee camps in Sudan, where the family lived for many years before they were resettled in Idaho. The parents berated themselves for not keeping them under constant supervision in their new home. \u201cThey had this feeling of, \u2018Oh, my gosh. We made a big mistake coming here. We were not prepared,\u2019\u201d Eujayl said. \nDespite their remorse, Eujayl was unsparing. \u201cThey are responsible for their children,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to face the reality. No pity here.\u201d \nIn general, Eujayl rejects any suggestion that the Muslim community in Twin Falls should feel victimized. Over the last four years, he told me, the Islamic Center has been vandalized about once a year. As the mosque\u2019s spokesperson, Eujayl insisted on keeping a low profile about the incidents \u2014 why make them more significant than they needed to be? \u201cThey vandalize the Mormon church, too,\u201d he said. \nNevertheless, Eujayl suspected that Twin Falls would one day come to see the Fawnbrook incident \u2014 the reported assault and the opportunistic displays of xenophobia that followed \u2014 as a dark and memorable episode. I met Eujayl a few days before Brigitte Gabriel was set to arrive in town, and he told me he was planning on attending her speech with his wife and son. It would no doubt be uncomfortable for them \u2014 a black, immigrant Muslim family. But he saw it as an obligation. \u201cI just want to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important. It\u2019s history.\u201d ID: 9692288 \nFor Gabriel\u2019s visit to Twin Falls, We the People Magic Valley arranged for the Three Percenters Club, a so-called patriot militia, to provide security. Two men in civilian clothing flanked the podium as she spoke, half-hidden behind stage curtains with their hands clasped in front of them. Gabriel repeatedly exhorted the audience to look across the Atlantic for a vision of what was coming to America: \u201cEurope has morphed to Eurabia. Europe is no longer the Europe that you used to go visit. It has been transformed.\u201d Refugee camps there, she said, were \u201cfilled with Muslims, not Christians,\u201d because the latter are \u201cworking hard and fending for themselves, not sitting in a refugee camp.\u201d \nNext to me, in the aisle on a folding chair to accommodate the tank feeding oxygen into his nostrils, sat a large man with a white beard. His name was Mike Mitchell. Wearing bib overalls with a crescent wrench sticking out of the front pocket, Mitchell would sometimes respond physically to the things Gabriel said. As he listened to her describe a Europe overrun by savages, he jabbed his index finger downward to point at the floor between his sneakers: Here. \n\u201cWe are importing people with a completely different value system.\u201d ID: 9693299 \nSoon after, Gabriel arrived at the apex of her speech. \u201cWe are importing people with a completely different value system that has no respect for women, that has no respect for daughters,\u201d she said. She enumerated a long series of sexual assaults and femicides allegedly committed by refugees across the United States, ending with the Fawnbrook case. \n\u201cToday, it\u2019s somebody you do not know,\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cNext, it will be your wife, your daughter, your girlfriend, your mother.\u201d \nThe following afternoon, in an immaculately well-maintained city park, We the People Magic Valley held a press conference about the Fawnbrook case. Julie Ruf took the lead, describing a city undergoing baleful changes. \u201cRefugees have been flooding into Twin Falls as cheap laborers. They live in squalor after their first six months,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of them are my personal friends.\u201d \nAs she spoke, a young, goateed man named Dino Omerefendic wandered into the park while playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. He stopped to listen, and after Ruf took a few questions from reporters, hesitantly chimed in: \u201cIt seems like you guys are painting every single refugee with the same brush,\u201d he said to Ruf. Omerefendic\u2019s family fled the Bosnian War of the 1990s when he was a child; he recalls spending a month in a bomb shelter eating stale rice cakes. Although he was born into Islam, Omerefendic has been irreligious as long as he can remember. \nOmerefendic asked why the activists weren\u2019t expressing similar outrage over other child victims of sexual assault. Ruf responded that she was just as concerned about every other case: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me who was raped, and it doesn\u2019t matter to me who was the rapist.\u201d \nI asked Ruf what, then, Islam had to do with the Fawnbrook case. \u201cAre you familiar with the ideology of Islam?\u201d she asked, before likening the religion to a fanatical cult that engages in incestuous sex with children. \u201cI\u2019m against that.\u201d Friday afternoon prayer service at the Twin Falls Islamic Center in Twin Falls, ID photographed on August 5th, 2016. Joe Jaszewski for BuzzFeed News ID: 9692138 \nEarlier that day, Imad Eujayl, the Islamic Center\u2019s spokesperson, arrived at the mosque to deliver the sermon for Friday prayers. For years, Twin Falls\u2019 Muslims have congregated in a small house in a residential neighborhood, which they long ago outgrew; that Friday, men sat in tight rows on the floor of the house\u2019s main room and spilled out into the hallways. \nNext door, on the same property, a half-built mosque had begun to take shape. Standing outside its pointed archway, Eujayl said that he had made good on his promise to take his family to see Gabriel speak. \u201cIt was tough,\u201d he said. \nEujayl\u2019s sermon that day focused on virtue as a communal practice, rather than an individual trait. \u201cAllah wants us to be part of a community,\u201d Eujayl said. \u201cTo use our Islam to enjoy the community around us, to enjoy the peace and the love which we give to our neighbors.\u201d \nWhen the service was over, the congregants walked outside to find that someone had left booklets on their parked cars: selections from the Bible, translated into Arabic. \u25cf David Noriega is a national reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in Los Angeles.

The searchable database will include 40 questions to detail previous employment, skill sets and strengths. \n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing from entry level to cabinet secretaries to ambassadors,\u201d Blanco said. \nSanchez said a chronic problem in politics is people saying that they can\u2019t find qualified Latinos to fill positions, one he argues is because they aren\u2019t looking. \nHe told the story of meeting with a secretary in the administration who said they didn\u2019t have quotas and only hire the best and the brightest, but understood they had a serious problem of underrepresentation of Latinos. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a serious problem of nepotism,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe want a system that is fair. Structurally in the nation there are high levels of favoritism, of friends hiring friends, and friends hiring family members. \nThe new effort follows in the footsteps of NHLA\u2019s Latino Appointments Program, created after a $250,000 Ford Foundation grant secured by Cristobal Alex, who went on to head Latino Victory before taking a leave to join Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \nSanchez points to the fact that there were no Latino cabinet officials at the campaign\u2019s outset and there are now four as evidence that the efforts are paying off. \nLatino operatives believe former Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar\u2019s role leading the transition will help Hispanics gain attention in hopes of joining the administration, should Clinton win. \nOscar Ramirez, a Democratic strategist at the Podesta Group, said public narratives of who is up for administration roles after the election often exclude qualified Latinos, women and minorities who are being considered. He pointed to California Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Rep. Xavier Becerra as two who will be considered for cabinet positions. \nA key to the Latino appointment effort is to create a pipeline of officials to step in when positions open up in a couple years, Ramirez said, echoing Blanco\u2019s argument that it is important Hispanics not to be limited to positions involving immigration, housing or labor. \nThe campaign\u2019s stated goal is to build on the NHLA initiative modeled after other programs like the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which has found success in increasing the number of LGBTQ appointees. \n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cAs Latinos we have been structurally excluded from a lot of these spaces of power and there will be no more excuses to say there aren\u2019t qualified Latinos for those spots.\u201d Adrian Carrasquillo is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York. Contact Adrian Carrasquillo at .", "Justin Sullivan / Getty Images ID: 9651680 \nStephanie Valencia Ramirez and John Jones, two operatives with experience in the Obama administration and on Capitol Hill, have joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s transition team, putting two prominent people of color in charge of strategic outreach to the Hill and constituency groups under former Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar, who serves as chair. \nRamirez starts Monday, according to three Latino strategists. Jones hire was confirmed by a CBC staffer and two other operatives. \nRamirez, who left the administration earlier this year to join Google, is considered a Latina leader among Hispanics in Washington, having worked for the Obama campaign in 2008, the transition team, and then the administration. She serves on the national committee for Latino Victory, which has helped Hispanic Democrats get elected. \nThe hire comes after news that Latino Victory and a coalition of 40 national Hispanic organizations have come together to create a resume bank of Latino candidates for political appointments in the next administration. \nAlida Garcia, executive director of Inclusv, which works to increase diversity hires in politics, said that if Clinton is elected, Valencia Ramirez will work to prioritize diversity and inclusion on the transition team because she has done so in every role she\u2019s had. \n\u201cShe sat me down in her office in the West Wing and asked what she could do to help me and if I could help her identify other young Latina leaders looking to serve,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThat\u2019s rare in this town, and that\u2019s how barriers of access for people of color begin to break down.\u201d \nJones, who was recommended to the transition team by the Congressional Black Caucus, two sources said, is a respected figure on and off Capitol Hill. As a chief of staff to Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, he\u2019s also well-connected with members in the House and Senate, especially inside the CBC. \nThe subject of transition is hot topic of conversation on the minds of White House operatives trying to figure out their next move, and for some Clinton campaign staff \u2014 from which there are plenty of black and Latino operatives to choose from for a Clinton White House \u2014 angling for potential White House appointments. \nInside black Democratic circles, operatives and strategists are actively figuring out what more can be done to ensure blacks are considered for positions, if Clinton is elected. In a spirited conversation about the subject of transition during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual policy convention, operatives observed how nice it would be, for instance, to see a black secretary of defense. \nBut it\u2019s not just the most high-profile cabinet positions black Democrats are paying attention to. With fewer than 50 days until the election, also up for discussion is how Clinton will staff key mid-level positions like political directors and communications staff. \nLatino Democrats similarly don\u2019t want potential appointments limited to the well-trodden ground of immigration, labor, and housing. Cesar Blanco, Latino Victory\u2019s interim director, also said he would like to see Hispanics considered for defense, trade, and foreign affairs roles. The key, operatives argue, is not just a focus on high-profile cabinet roles, but in creating a pipeline that will mean a wealth of candidates across departments for years to come. \nGarcia of Inclusv, said that regardless who wins, thousands of campaign staff of color will be looking for work. Her organization is gearing up for an \u201coff-boarding training program\u201d for campaign staff of color seeking mentors, career development and guidance pursuing their next jobs in politics. \nWith Salazar leading the transition, Valencia Ramirez coming onboard and the new Latino appointments initiative, Democrats feel primed to make advances on a key measure of Latino political power. \n\u201cThe right people are being elevated,\u201d a Clinton official said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be engaged on meaningful outreach. It\u2019s a sign the Latino community is growing.\u201d \nOver and over, people talking about transition laud the Obama administration for its innovation \u2014 he appointed two black attorney generals, made Jeh Johnson director of Homeland Security, and has four Latinos in the cabinet. While many contend Obama doesn\u2019t get enough credit, people believe Clinton will be graded on a higher curve. \n\u201cHillary Clinton won\u2019t get to slide,\u201d a senior Democratic strategist said. \u201cPeople are going to be tough and demanding.

Finding Help And Healing Through Santeria Cuban santero Rudy Guardiola has hundreds of \u201cgodchildren\u201d in New York and around the US. Like the religion itself, many of its followers, including young people who were drawn to Santeria over trendier forms of spirituality, are in a constant struggle to survive. At Rudy\u2019s botanica, they find safety, healing, and hope. Chaya Babu BuzzFeed Contributor \nThe sunlight falls in a perforated line down the sidewalk on Broadway where the J and M trains click by on rusty green tracks overhead. Graffitied columns facing two unisex beauty salons, a florist with a neon \u201cSe Habla Espa\u00f1ol\u201d sign in the window, and a mobile retailer punctuate the commercial strip of Brooklyn\u2019s Bushwick neighborhood, rooted in piles of dirty snow and bags of garbage. It\u2019s here that Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed\u2019s door opens to long metal shelves stocked with glass-encased pillar candles and sachets of herbs. Though two large nylon flags that seem more appropriate for a surf shop than a spiritual goods store flap in the breeze outside, \u201cBOTANICA\u201d written prominently on both, many of those who stop by regularly say they\u2019ve walked past for years without so much as glancing at the place. \nOn a Thursday afternoon in February, all the patrons who came in took a seat on one of the plastic chairs that butt up against a wall of bottled perfumes and potions \u2014 everything from Miel de Amor (Honey of Love) and Exito (Success) to Quita Maldicion (Go Away Evil) and Santa Muerte (Holy Death). By 3:00, there were eight people waiting, their heads bent to their phone screens, a few talking quietly in pairs. With nowhere else to sit, some created a queue that neared the entrance where a dusty, black-robed Grim Reaper stands guard, its jewel-orbed eyes glowing red and a scale in its right hand, the arbiter of justice. \nBotanica literally translates to \u201cbotany store\u201d or \u201cplant store\u201d for its historic purpose as an establishment that sells medicinal herbs in Latin America. Most also carry a range of other spiritual amulets and items, including oils and Florida Water, beads and statuary. And like many of its kind, at least in name, Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed is also a place for consultas , readings, and limpiezas , or cleansings, and more. \nHere, Rudy Guardiola, an Afro-Cuban santero \u2014 a priest in Santeria, a religion descending from indigenous African spiritual traditions \u2014 conducts such services. Before Rudy opened his shop along with the \u201cChurch of the Orishas\u201d in its basement 24 years ago, he had been practicing out of his home \u2014 common for healers who don\u2019t feel the need to mix spirituality with the realities of running a business. And while on some days he has ten clients and others only two or even none, that afternoon was a testament to his highly coveted wisdom. \nThough several stray white customers entered, browsed, flashed self-conscious half-smiles, and left, all of those who lingered were black or Latino, some from within a few-block radius, others from outside the borough. G., who is Puerto Rican but was born in the US, explained that Rudy\u2019s reputation and his English drew her back to him. She came \u201cjust for questions\u201d that she said would otherwise get lost in translation with santeros who speak only Spanish. \n\u201cWe would never put \u2018psychic\u2019 in the window or something like that,\u201d said Lawrence Somerville, one of Rudy\u2019s \u201cgodsons,\u201d a soon-to-be formal initiate who also works at the store. \u201cThat\u2019s not really what it is, and people would probably run the other way.\u201d The godsons are like a brotherhood of sorts, congregating behind the counter, where bunches of sage hang drying from a ribbon stretched from the wall to a radiator pipe with chipping paint. Rudy\u2019s own kids are grown up, one living in Georgia and the other in the army \u2014 they\u2019ve given him seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild \u2014 so the men in their late twenties and early thirties who idle and joke at the botanica are like another family to him. Some are unofficial godsons, with no plans of being formally initiated but welcomed into the folds of the group nonetheless. One can\u2019t help but wonder about the magical haunts veiled in ordinary brick-and-mortar among our lives of logic and material gain. ID: 9600468 \nOne by one, the clients, bundled in their coats, holding on to whatever drove them to seek counsel, got their turn. Rudy came out from a room in the back, took each by the hand, and led them around the counter and through a dark doorframe to cast shells or coconuts on the ground and tell them something that came to him from the Orishas, or gods. His frame is stocky and his gait more a shuffle than a walk. And at 59, he has a youthful air, a guilelessness, despite his father figure role \u2014 his godchildren refer to him as \u201cPadrino\u201d\u2014 and obviously keen business acumen. He\u2019s a man of few words apart from fervent punches about Santeria, the people for whom he provides guidance, and how relentlessly busy he is. \nWhen G. emerged from her session, she walked swiftly to the exit, her hood pulled over her head and her fingers gripping her coat tightly shut. Her long, brown hair was wet and her gaze downward as she beelined for Broadway. Boogey, the botanica cat, squinted and yawned after her, keeping watch from his perch near a sculpture of a Catholic saint and rows of rosaries that hung from nails on a board. His eyes quivered. \n\u201cWe say that he\u2019s been in here so long that he sees all the spirits that come through, so most of the time when he\u2019s looking at you, he\u2019s looking at the spirits around you, too,\u201d Lawrence said with a laugh. \nWhile exploring the cluster of botanicas in northeast Brooklyn, curios tucked into blocks that are rapidly turning \u2014 sandwiched between massive fluorescent-lit laundromats and tony lounges that serve craft cocktails \u2014 one can\u2019t help but wonder about the magical haunts veiled in ordinary brick-and-mortar among our lives of logic and material gain, the meaning we assign the small rituals that unite us with something bigger, and, most poignantly, whose magic matters. \n\u201cAmong the Latino community, wellness isn\u2019t trendy,\u201d Christian, a 35-year-old education professor and priest of Oshun, Orisha of love and sweet waters, told me one evening during a festive gathering at Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed. \u201cLook around you. This isn\u2019t the nice 14th Street bookstore where you smell beautiful scents of incense burning or yoga pamphlets outside.\u201d \nToday, Google Maps drops nine pins in the Bushwick neighborhood alone in a search for \u201cbotanicas.\u201d And while not all who visit botanicas may explicitly identify with the religion or even believe at all, there they find solutions to both physical and mental health issues, for which many lack access to adequate care. Orisha worship, however altered from its origins, maintains a connection to its legacy during slavery in that it provides a lifeline in a world intent on the silent erasure of communities of color. City dwellers caught up in the daily hustle of just trying to survive in an age of exorbitant wealth inequality, police brutality, entrenched housing segregation coupled with the violence of gentrification, and a slew of other injustices are devoting their time and energy to becoming new loyal followers of Santeria. For many in the religion and its purlieu, the consciousness embraced on this spiritual path is one specifically intertwined with a link to ancestral spirits and the remembrance of a home before diaspora, a heritage untouched by colonialism, and an enduring faith in the resilience of a self rooted in African identity. \nAt Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed, the young people who have sought out Rudy in times of loss and despair have stumbled upon a sanctuary of healing, a salve for the wounds of systemic trauma they were long unable to name. \n\u201cI live for my people,\u201d Rudy told me. \u201cI live for my religion; I live for my faith; this is my life.\u201d Rudy standing at the coutner of Botanica Orisha Locumi talking to Miguel. Marlon Krieger For Buzzfeed News ID: 9599530 \n\u201cI\u2019m nothing; my power is not my power,\u201d Rudy said, pensive, earnest, searching for words as he stood leaning against a table in the dank cell at the back of his shop. \u201cI surprise myself: How do I know these things? It\u2019s something with me, something spiritual with me.\u201d \nIt\u2019s the messages of divination that he was speaking of, which come through him about someone\u2019s undetected cancer or what they need to do to find a job. This, and his abilities to then call upon the Orishas to bless and bring positive energy to a situation, lead people to want to be in his orbit. He has over 400 godchildren he has brought into Santeria and that doesn\u2019t count those who frequent his store, or those who watch and call in to his hour-long television show Los Secretos de las Religiones on the Dominican View channel, which airs in the US, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and a number of other countries. \nHe arrived to the US from Cuba in 1980 and was crowned Obatal\u00e1 in New York in 1983, meaning he was initiated formally into the religion with Obatal\u00e1 as his guardian Orisha. Obatal\u00e1 is the creator, the sculptor of mankind, and the father of all the gods. Rudy\u2019s relationship with the Orishas is one that unfolded as a natural step in his journey, and it\u2019s now one he feels intimately: \u201cThe connection\u2026I can\u2019t live without it because it follows me.\u201d \n\u201cAll my family is santero in Cuba pero I come to the country very young, 17, and very crazy,\u201d he told me, his speech a mix of his two languages. \u201cAt 17, I don\u2019t want to do nothing you know? And then three years later, maybe 19, 20, I crowned Santo.\u201d \u201cYour son is a spiritual man. The spirit is with him, and let him deliver that spirit.\u201d ID: 9600473 \nHe remembers that 10 years prior to his migration with his mother, he had visions of their coming to the US by boat. \u201cI tell her, \u2018You know what? Mami, I see that one day I leave my country on the water, not plane, water\u2019\u2014 it\u2019s so far and so dangerous but I dreamed it,\u201d he said. This was far before the announcement of the Mariel boatlift \u2014 the mass exodus of Cubans to the United States in 1980 during which approximately 125,000 Cubans, dubbed \u201cMarielitos,\u201d crossed the Florida Straits \u2014 but Rudy foretold their travels. By then he had gotten used to this \u201csomething gift\u201d of his, which he had become aware of when he was 11. \n\u201cI started to shake-shake-shake; my mother think I have epilepsy, people think I have epilepsy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother sent me to something spiritual in Cuba and there we found a person and he tell her, \u2018Your son is not epileptic. Your son is a spiritual man. The spirit is with him, and let him deliver that spirit.\u2019\u201d \nA full breath moved in and out of his barrel-like chest before he continued. \n\u201cOne day I remember, me and my mother were waiting for the bus coming up, and I tell my mother, \u2018Mami, I want to walk two blocks from here, something happens here in the bus stop,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cShe said, \u2018What? No no, come come come.\u2019 I said, \u2018No no, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t stay here.\u2019 She said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And then me and my mother walked like a half block; I see something noise and I turn. I see the bus hit somebody and kill somebody there. And then my mother believed too. I don\u2019t know who told me to remove my mother from there.\u201d \nNot all botanicas have someone like Rudy, a santero or espiritist, running the place, but most are much more than a marketplace of herbal remedies, books on magic in Spanish, and a surfeit of candles with San Miguel or Juan de la Conquista illustrations; some have santeros who are licensed medical professionals and doctors in their home countries whose credentials don\u2019t cross over. In New York and other urban locales in the US, botanicas serve as points of connection and belonging in an \u201cinformal economy of healing,\u201d as put by immigration and health sociologist Anah\u00ed Viladrich, for the communities in areas where they are located. Typically they can be spotted in neighborhoods with high counts of Afro-Caribbean and Latino immigrants, many of whom may face barriers to the US health care system ( 35% of Hispanics report difficulties with accessing quality care).

Customers find their way in through word of mouth and reputation of the owner. And not only is it a tough gamble to make rent in hot neighborhoods like Bushwick by selling enough $4 boxes of baths for Suerte (luck) or Atrapa Hombre (catching a man), but often these are only the surface trappings of vibrant though hidden lairs of spiritual work. This \u201c\u2018invisible world of folk healing\u201d as Viladrich put it, which thrives in the back rooms and basements of many botanicas, propels forward ancient earth-based traditions in what, on its face, might look like the unlikeliest of modern settings. \nStill, many such spots are just businesses, and the question of authenticity amid the increasing commercialization of Santeria \u2014 manifested by the influx of largely white travelers to Cuba, some of whom take part in the consumption and appropriation of Orisha tradition, and the fact that the largest botanica in New York is owned by a Jewish non-practitioner \u2014 is one that comes up frequently among those in the religion and, not surprisingly, between botanica owners themselves. \nUntil a fire led to its closing in June, across the street from Rudy\u2019s was Botanica La Jose, a narrow, carpeted boutique bathed in darkness, where a woman named Carmen sat behind a curtain past the haphazard clutter of soaps and statues of saints. She said, simply, \u201cToma mi numero,\u201d pointing to her cards, which had instructions on how to make an appointment. Her cramped alley of a store felt much more like the dwellings of a fortune-teller as depicted in popular culture. K., a young white woman browsing the shelves at Botanica Las Mercedes, also in Bushwick, said she shops at botanicas, pronouncing them \u201cbaw-tanicas,\u201d for herbs or other products related to occult practice and vouched for Rudy\u2019s place as legit. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s the most popular one,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThat botanica is a botanica for its name, but no, no, no, no,\u201d Rudy said about Botanica La Jose, slamming a hand down on the tabletop where a severed goat\u2019s head lies just a few feet away. \u201cSome botanicas don\u2019t have a base. \u2018What do you practice?\u2019\u2018Spiritual.\u2019 You can be spiritual, anybody can be spiritual \u2014 there\u2019s the spiritual and the material, everyone has spirit. Pero everybody doesn\u2019t have Orishas. Orishas. You have to be baptized as an Orisha. You have to pay for that, you have to feel the roots, the roots .\u201d \nIt\u2019s these roots, steeped in indigenous Yoruba tradition, that keep Santeria cloaked in exoticism and even taboo to many on the outside looking in, particularly in comparison to other alternative medicine and healing practices that have become mainstream in the US. Santeria, also known as Regla de Ocha or Regla de If\u00e1 and a descendant of the If\u00e1 Yoruba religion, was born on the sugarcane plantations of Cuba and is a sister of Candombl\u00e9 from Brazil, Vodou in Haiti, Shango in Trinidad, and others. All stemming from nature-based worship in West Africa, they were transported to the Americas during the slave trade and syncretized, disguised in the imagery and iconography of Catholicism as colonialism threatened to otherwise wipe them out completely. They have now found a new place as large swaths of immigrants from Latin America have predominantly settled in Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. In spite of growing interest in and greater visibility of the Orisha traditions, traces of their demonization in the Western imagination that drove them underground in the first place as early as the sixteenth century still exist. An altar at the foot of Santa Muerte Marlon Krieger For Buzzfeed News ID: 9599578 \nIn late 2014, a series of incidents involving goat heads turning up in Brooklyn\u2019s Prospect Park, including one in which two heads were tied together and flung over a streetlamp pole like a pair of sneakers, sparked a frenzy of accusations that Santeria was behind the mysterious disposals. Though other explanations were offered alongside suggestions that the remains were those of ritual offering, the language used in much of the reporting, phrases like \u201c sinister force ,\u201d harkened to an earlier time when Afro-Caribbean religions were distorted and lumped into the misnomer \u201cvoodoo,\u201d a word that conjures evil hexes and cloth dolls stuck with needles. \nIn the 1980s, when Rudy began practicing as a santero, American pop culture was particularly frantic in its obsession with all things occult and reveled in pointing fingers at Afro-Caribbean religions for their \u201cblack magic.\u201d The film The Believers, a thriller that showed Santeria as devil worship essentially, came out in 1987, and was part of a spate of similarly ignorant and racist movies about Orisha tradition, including Angel Heart (1987) and The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988). The craze crossed into international relations: in 1989, when an American military force in Panama invaded the home of elusive dictator General Manuel Noriega, its commander reported that it had seized \u201cvoodoo artifacts\u201d in what became widely known as Noriega\u2019s \u201c witch house ,\u201d totems allegedly wielded to keep the drug lord in power. Deputy Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Charles V. Wetli, an expert on santeria and palo mayombe, sitting in his office with artifacts. Debra Lex / Getty Images ID: 9600002 \nThe \u201980s also saw a string of NYPD raids on botanicas and other practitioner locations, busting and fining them for animal cruelty. (Anyone familiar with Santeria will explain that ritual slaughter is conducted only by the highest order of priests and entails meticulous care in the handling of all of the animals\u2019 parts. Rudy\u2019s take: \u201cYou no seen the movies? Jesus movies? You see people with the lamb? Sacrifice. The same thing. It\u2019s a religion thing.\u201d) But Santeria crossed a major official hurdle in the US when the Supreme Court removed the ban on animal sacrifice in a landmark religious freedom case in 1993, Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah . Regardless of that victory, Rudy\u2019s first years in New York were amid a climate of hostility toward the faith and its followers. Back then, the perception of Santeria as a religion \u201cfor black people only\u201d contributed to the fear, he said, touching on how racism, in all of the various times and places in which Orisha worship has flourished, has fueled the stigmas associated with it. \nBut even now as Beyonc\u00e9 struts her stuff in a flowing yellow dress in Lemonade evoking the fiercely feminine energy of Oshun, also a goddess of sensuality and fertility, the esoteric haze around Santeria persists and an insularity pervades its ranks. Everyone I spoke to who comes to Rudy found him through word of mouth: a whisper about his prophetic prowess from a co-worker, an invitation to join a friend at a basement toque (musical ritual), the gentle nudge from the woman next door during times of hardship. Whatever the present-day image of Santeria, its obscurity is partly reinforced by the protective hush of many devotees, and getting in is not as simple as learning a few patakis, or sacred stories that are passed on orally. Kinship ties are based on ritual descent, with spiritual knowledge handed down from santero to apprentice, or godparent to godchild, in a reciprocal duty-bound bond. \nJustin Siegel, the former manager of Italo\u2019s BK, a chic caf\u00e9 that opened in December next to Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed and has a studio in the back where yoga and meditation classes are often held, called the botanica \u201cone of those voodoo shops\u201d with a knowing smile and dismissive roll of his eyes. \u201cThey do a lot of weird stuff over there, especially on Saturday nights; it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know [Rudy] because we\u2019re all neighbors here, but he\u2019s one of those people who\u2019s like, \u2018Give us money and we\u2019ll give you success,\u2019 and, uh, that\u2019s not how life works.\u201d But Justin was quick to endorse a healing studio in Greenpoint called Golden Drum, which has everything from astrology and Kundalini workshops to shamanic sound healing sessions featuring the sacred vibrations of crystal bowls, didgeridoos, bells, gongs, and more, each for about $30 a pop. Herbal combinations to be poured over the body stating different spiritual or material gains Marlon Krieger for Buzzfeed News ID: 9599671 \nOn a frigid February weekend, while white kids with blue mohawks and ripped jeans smoked cigarettes outside of the corner bar, the hypnotic cadence of Yoruba incantations and drumbeats erupted from the icy ground at 893 Broadway through open cellar doors that lead to a cement staircase. Inside the botanica, the pulse of the celebration down below was muted, and the space behind the counter was functioning as a staging area of sorts for those who were yet to play their part in the public ceremony, a \u201cbirthday\u201d honoring Elegua, or rather the one-year anniversary of an iyawo being crowned Elegua as their guardian Orisha. ( Iyawo is the term for a novice initiate in their first year of making santo.) Rudy was at his best dressed, in a plaid Burberry sweater over white pants and Gucci shoes, with a white knit cap over his buzzed undercut and long locks pulled back into a ponytail. He modeled how to style a white scarf for a dewy-faced iyawo who watched intently. \u201cComo\u201d\u2014 Rudy stuck a pose, throwing the scarf behind his neck, pulling the ends taut at his waist, one knee bent; \u201cComo\u201d\u2014 another freeze, his head cocked back, lips pursed. His flock of godsons laughed. \n\u201cI went to knock on other doors and they wouldn\u2019t open for me,\u201d said Erica Small, 30, wearing a starched white dress with sleeves to her wrists and a tightly wrapped white turban, waiting to descend with her plate of candles and coconuts for the Orishas. Erica was crowned daughter of Yemaya in December, but she has known Rudy for over a decade. She said she was going through an extreme depression around the time they met. She looked toward the paths of healing that were more readily available to her \u2014 from the pastors at her family\u2019s church to other spiritual readers \u2014 but nothing worked. \n\u201cI was desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed something really serious that was going to save my life. And my spirit ended up connecting here. I felt it so deep.\u201d \nErica\u2019s mother is black, born in the US, and her father is Haitian, but she grew up Pentecostal with no overt ties to indigenous African religion \u2014 though, looking back, she said she can see how it\u2019s always been in her DNA. As someone who has had a profound sense of intuition since childhood, Erica felt the spirits of her ancestors calling her to go back to the African part of her bloodline (and the friend who directed her to Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed more than 10 years ago sent her there on the suggestion that she buy the Black African Power candle). \nShe lives in Williamsburg now but was raised in East New York, a Brooklyn neighborhood still notorious for its poverty and violence long after the demise of the city\u2019s soaring crime during the crack-riddled \u201980s and \u201990s. In 1993, when she was a child growing up there, East New York was listed as having the highest number of homicides that year, 126, out of all the neighborhoods in the city; in the past years, as the bigger picture of violent crime in New York has plummeted to record lows since the \u201960s, the 75th Precinct \u2014 once known by cops as \u201cthe killing fields\u201d \u2014 lags, with murders up again nearly twofold since 2008. It\u2019s where, in 2014, NYPD officer Peter Liang shot Akai Gurley in the Louis H. Pink Houses and failed to call for aid. (Liang was later sentenced to five years of probation and community service after the judge ruled the shooting an accident.) \n\u201cA lot has happened in my life, a lot of things I\u2019ve seen growing up in rough neighborhoods and stuff like that,\u201d Erica said, attempting to explain the inexplicable \u2014 that Rudy was able to offer her something in his low-lit chamber for consultas that provided her with the resolve she needed to overcome her suffering. \u201cWhen I say \u2018rough,\u2019 I mean that when I was 8 years old, someone\u2019s brains were blown out and they left the guy\u2019s brains there for over a week. Out in the street in the back of the building. And me and my friends played with the brains. That\u2019s severe. That\u2019s traumatic\u2026 I will never forget that.\u201d She was hesitant to share the exact details of what Rudy did, just that he taught her how to be there for herself. \u201cPeople who come to me, they don\u2019t leave without something good.\u201d ID: 9600475 \nScholarly work on Santeria has pointed to its legacy as a form of cultural resistance to the dominant forces in society. During slavery in the Caribbean, the choice to hold on to African-based spirituality, when one could be killed for it, was symbolic of this refusal to acquiesce to the brutal efforts by the colonizers to impose shackles upon not only the bodies but the minds of black slaves. Today, when young people like Erica grow up where men in their communities are shot and then abandoned \u2014 a circumstance that hasn\u2019t changed much in the 20 years since the incident she described \u2014 pushing back on the toll of that level of dehumanization is indeed resistance. \n\u201cI hear a lot of things, a lot of things,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cMy god, you don\u2019t know where to start because it\u2019s a lot of things, so many questions. I don\u2019t know how I can answer those questions. But it\u2019s okay. I love my job. I love it. It\u2019s my life. I like helping people. Maybe I have worse problems; maybe I have more problems than them. Pero I try to not show my problems. I try to be calm.\u201d \nHe relayed stories of people coming to him in various states of distress: pregnant teenagers, raped and beaten by their fathers; homesick immigrants with a loneliness so acute they long to return to countries they fled; HIV patients fighting suicidal thoughts as they grapple with their diagnoses. \n\u201cPeople who come to me, they don\u2019t leave without something good,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cTo convince the person that life is big, God is with me and you, you\u2019re not lonely, it\u2019s something you have to pass through in this life to be stronger, this life is not for people to be weak, it\u2019s for strong people \u2014 I tell them something like that in Spanish. And people listen to me. And it changes their life.\u201d \nErica and another iyawo, a middle-aged woman, entered from the stairwell into the steady throb of four drums and the undulating vocals of Alexi, a dark-skinned man with a walker who comes from Philadelphia to sing at the toques de fundamento , or tambores (drummings). About 70 people lined the perimeter of the basement, its walls covered in lurid floor-to-ceiling painted murals of both black and white saints, from La Virgen de Regla and La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre to San Hilarion smoking a pipe next to a bucket of skulls, snakes, and tridents, with the sun a glowing marigold orb behind him. And at the far end of the cavernous space, an altar decked in a thick layer of green leaves overflowed with a rotunda of fruit, new toys, and 10 cakes that read \u201cFelicidades Elegua\u201d\u2014 a sort of tropical jungle Christmas morning explosion. Many of the women were in long white skirts, beneath which jeans and leather boots peaked out from the hems. Erica and her godsister briefly lay prostrate at the feet of the drummers as they gave their offerings. \nThree sons of Elegua were being celebrated that night, all in court jester costumes symbolic of the Orisha\u2019s trickster quality. They danced in a line in the area in front of Alexi and the drummers in the center of the floor, where only those invited by the Orishas were permitted to join. One pulled Rudy away and whispered something to him in the corner: A message from a spirit had come through him, Christian, the young education professor moving subtly to the beat, explained. Throughout the night, Rudy stepped away from his position in the middle of the room to greet guests with hugs, check on the altar, and ensure everything was going smoothly in the kitchen, where Berta, who has worked for him since 1984, heaped ladles of steaming rice, beans, chicken, and fish onto paper plates. \nThe party for Elegua revealed just how vast Rudy\u2019s reach is in and around the city, with Christian having grown up in Manhattan and others traveling from New Jersey and Connecticut. Lyonel, a retired salesman who is a practitioner of the Haitian tradition of Vodou, heard about the tambor on Facebook and drove to Bushwick from Queens; Miriam, a community organizer, comes to toques frequently from Long Island. A man sitting inside Botanica orisha Locumi Marlon Krieger For Buzzfeed News ID: 9599726 \nLike the pioneering souls who planted the seeds of Orisha tradition in New York before him, Rudy nurtured from scratch the sphere he calls \u201chis people\u201d when he began practicing as a santero. \nBabalawo Pancho Mora was the first to practice If\u00e1 divination in New York. He arrived from Cuba in 1946 and shortly after founded the first ile , or house of the Orishas, in the city. At the time, music was critical to the religion\u2019s burgeoning presence in New York City even as the traditions hung low beneath the bustle of the urban American zeitgeist. Though many of the Cuban musicians who were influential in this process had not been formally initiated, their immersion in Santeria from their upbringings meant that the philosophies and practices of the religion traveled with them and found a home on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side. And by 1964, following the Cuban Revolution\u2019s tide of exiles flooding the community and swelling the number of practitioners in New York from a handful to thousands, Afro-Cuban music had crossed borders within borders, drawing a crowd of 3,000 to a drumming ceremony held by Pancho Mora. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in business, especially in New York City.\u201d ID: 9600478 \nBut that era is long gone \u2014 the Palladium, which became known as \u201chome of the mambo,\u201d held its final performance in 1966, and most of the botanicas that were in the area have closed. The neighborhoods with the densest count of botanicas have moved over the decades, with the shops slowly disappearing from blocks in Washington Heights and the Lower East Side and shifting around throughout the other boroughs, now situated mostly across the Bronx, Jackson Heights in Queens, and Sunset Park and of course Bushwick in Brooklyn. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to stay in business, especially in New York City,\u201d said Jason Mizrahi, owner of Original Products, a veritable emporium of botanica goods in the Bronx and wholesale supplier to stores locally and nationwide, as he charted the trajectory of the dwindling botanicas across the boroughs. \u201cAll the rents have gone up.\u201d \nThough the presence of botanicas does not determine the continuation of the religion, which will follow its people (\u201cWe\u2019ve always done it \u2014 public, undercover, wherever, whenever,\u201d Marta Moreno Vega, founder and director of the Caribbean Cultural Center African Diaspora Institute, told me), they are gems in ethnic enclaves that are repeatedly displaced as gentrification uproots New York\u2019s most vulnerable communities, including working-class Latinos and Afro-Caribbeans. A small botanica down Broadway, just feet away from Rudy\u2019s, the inside gutted and the glass storefront cracked, shuttered only weeks ago.

Two young women look down at the basement of the Botanica upon hearing the ceremonial music and singing Marlon Krieger for BuzzFeed News ID: 9599746 \nOne day at noon as spring crept over the train tracks, Gabriel, who works behind the counter, answered the phone taking consulta appointments with a Spanish ballad blaring in the background, and Lawrence was in and out of the store, between the two floors, getting things in order for the coming weekend\u2019s toque. \u201cI have another job in IT, but my boss is a godson as well so he knows that Padrino takes priority,\u201d Lawrence said. Walter, an honorary godson, passed around a bag of gummy worms, his vertical \u201cBROOKLYN\u201d tattoo exposed down his forearm. \nRudy was in the middle of a particularly hectic day, having come from court because he said his tenants don\u2019t pay him rent (he\u2019s also a landlord, with four properties between New York and Florida), but not too hectic to keep him from stopping to plant a kiss on the head of Jacob, who looks no older than 25, before taking the hand of a client and walking her to the back. The young men could pass for a boy band in their black puffy vests, baseball caps with super-stiff brims, and squeaky clean Jordans with their all-white outfits. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he gets it or why,\u201d Lawrence said of Rudy\u2019s endless supply of energy. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he has little kids he\u2019s putting through college. He maybe makes a $200 profit a month off this store. But it helps to facilitate all of his other work; it acts as more of an office for him. You know, if you want to find him, this is where you can find him.\u201d \nLawrence was living with Rudy for the time being as he got on his feet to find an apartment. There are no non-botanica days for his padrino, he said, having been privy for months to the quotidian realities of Rudy\u2019s utter devotion to his practice as a santero. This of course leaves out travels to Cuba and elsewhere to conduct initiations \u2014 one Saturday evening in early April, I caught Rudy after a closed crowning ceremony in the basement; he had flown in earlier that day from doing the same in Florida and was about to fly right back out on the following Monday for another. \n\u201cHe is by far the hardest-working man I\u2019ve never known, and I\u2019ve been around a lot of hard-working people; he\u2019s like almost inhuman,\u201d Lawrence said, later describing Rudy\u2019s lifestyle as comfortable, far from extravagant. He lives in a two-bedroom apartment in East Elmhurst and although he drives to the botanica every day in his Mercedes, he never takes vacations free of toting-along godchildren who want to be crowned santo in Cuba. \nLawrence, who\u2019s 33 and half African-American and half Puerto Rican, was gearing up for his own crowning ceremony this fall, anxious about saving enough money. On top of everything else, the logistics around the rites of passage can add up to several thousand dollars, with costs for seven days of food for the iyawos, payment for people serving them, animals for the rituals, and materials for dressing the altar. He came to Rudy while he was at a crossroads about two years prior, trying to reroute his life after taking wrong turn after wrong turn. Following a number of face-to-face confrontations with death, as he put it, including getting diagnosed with late-stage Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma in 2010 and going into remission six months later, it was losing a friend to a drug-related overdose that served as his awakening. \u201cI was like, how is it that I\u2019m acting like someone who\u2019s grateful to have another chance? I\u2019m not.\u201d \nLawrence and I drove around Bushwick one morning, buying plastic cups and plates at the 99-cent megastore and stopping in to check out Catland, a pagan bookshop with dark wood shelves holding little witchy wonders like crystals, tarot decks, and a smooth, green, palm-sized Elegua statue that Lawrence thumbed in awe before noting the $40 price tag. We parked briefly on Varet Street; a mammoth yellow crane sat in an empty construction lot that holds the debris from the demolished home Lawrence\u2019s mother grew up in as a child (his father, now deceased, was in his life but physically absent). Staring out into the chill, he recalled having graduated eighth in his class in high school, starting college, but then being pulled into the allure of fast money on the streets while simultaneously bartending. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think any smart drug dealer would stay selling weed, because after a while you have to graduate, you know,\u201d Lawrence said, in his white sweater and white sweatpants albeit not having attained official iyawo status yet. He looked back to when he was on the brink of getting swept further into the drug trade; this is where he found himself when an alternate journey, one with a nurtured connection to the Orishas, appeared. \n\u201cI made the conscious decision to retire, leave that whole game, the hustling life, alone,\u201d he said, reflective, attributing the renewal in and around him, his newfound stability, wholly to Rudy. \u201cBut it was always very easy for me to slip back in at any given moment, anytime I needed to make a quick buck or something. I can, but I won\u2019t do it. Why? I hear him in my head\u2026 That fire that he lights under my ass that causes me to stress, to lose the hair on my head, is all him trying to push me to do more and better for myself.\u201d \nThat Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed functions as a therapeutic space is perhaps its least perceptible facet. When it comes to remedies for bodily issues, most who visit botanicas for herbal medicine do so as complementary to regular visits to a physician; but when it comes to the other pieces of holistic wellness, the integration of mind, body, and soul, someone like Rudy along with his peripheral universe is an invaluable resource to his people. \u201cPeople who used to be drug dealers, prostitutes, jobless, or depressed \u2014 suddenly they found a model, they found hope, they found a community.\u201d ID: 9600481 \nViladrich, whose research spans more than a decade and who met Rudy in that time, explained that the healing map in the city is rigidly divided by class and ethnic differences \u2014 with practices such as acupuncture dissociated from their origins and absorbed by the Western medical establishment \u2014 and that a santero can offer the cultural currency and relevant treatment that\u2019s often missing within the scope of conventional mental health, counseling, or social services. \u201cThey speak the same language not only in terms of idiomatic expressions but also in terms of the problems they share,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey understand what the client has gone through. You may go to a psychologist, the psychologist doesn\u2019t know how to help someone with a deportation case who may be afraid of going to a lawyer. \u2026 People who used to be drug dealers, prostitutes, jobless, or depressed \u2014 suddenly they found a model, they found hope, they found a community, they found a purpose, they found peace.\u201d \nBack at the store, Lawrence teased Walter about having been recently fired from his job at a packing company. Though Lawrence has a dignified air and Walter bleeds mischief, there\u2019s a palpable camaraderie between them, the buoying of a shared experience. For both of them, their padrino provides a semblance of protection. \n\u201cHe tries to bless me,\u201d 29-year-old Walter said, relaying how Rudy\u2019s divination rightly predicted that he wouldn\u2019t go back to prison for getting caught dealing drugs despite being on parole, that he\u2019d be released from Rikers where he was awaiting his sentence after already serving three years upstate for gun possession. \u201cWhen he told me that I was coming out, I believed it, okay, I had the faith in court, and then they let me go. I was so happy, I came and I shook the bell, and I spoke to Yemaya and everything.\u201d \nGrowing up in the Hylan Houses and Borinquen Plaza, both housing projects not far from Botanica Orisha Locum\u00ed, Walter, unlike Lawrence, had a rough upbringing and admitted to a long history of brushes with the law. Gangs were outside his front door. Gangs were in his family. Also half African-American and half Puerto Rican, he could easily have remained a statistic, part of the 60% of our prison population represented by people of color, and potentially subject to a mandatory-minimum sentence, which black defendants are 21 % more likely to receive than their white counterparts. \n\u201cWithout that faith, listen, I believe I woulda just went wherever \u2014 you probably wouldn\u2019t even see me today; I\u2019d probably just be over there,\u201d Walter flicked his wrist dismissively, there meaning nowhere really. \u201cRudy\u2019s pretty powerful, you know? When he asks for something, he gets it.\u201d He added that this power is shared with him at no cost. \n\u201cWhen you come here, if you have no money, I help you,\u201d Rudy told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not business. Business is when you\u2019re making money to profit. So you come in with a problem and no money, I do the reading without money. \u2026 Old ladies or people sick, I don\u2019t charge.\u201d \nLaced through the testimonies of the godsons was an undertone of Rudy having saved them from whatever darker fate might have befallen them. \u201cI don\u2019t get involved with no gangs, nothing like that,\u201d Walter said of his new ways. \u201cI\u2019m into\u2026\u201d he paused. \u201cThis: I\u2019m into peace, I\u2019m into things that smell good.\u201d He rotated a cylinder of cascarilla \u2014 chalky crushed egg shells \u2014 in his hands, and grinned. Laurence inside Botanica Orisha Locumi. Marlon Krieger for Buzz Feed News ID: 9599782 \nIt\u2019s possible that the process of exposing Orisha tradition to broader American society is a dance not so different from coaxing the gods to come down at a toque \u2014 slow, tempered, methodical. Many who practice are quiet about it. Christian said that no one on the faculty of the university where he works knows he\u2019s a santero, and he prefers to keep it that way; he called individuals like Vega \u201cthe out academics.\u201d Other prominent voices are vehement about its integration into our mainstream culture, emphasizing its role in daily wellness, not so different from the fashionable forms taught at healing centers with eclectic practices, as well as the fact that its believers span socioeconomic backgrounds. \n\u201cSanteria gets a bad rap,\u201d Christian explained. \u201cIt\u2019s such a marginal religion; it\u2019s such a misunderstood religion. \u2026 But it\u2019s more than all this mystery. It\u2019s about the inner life.\u201d \n\u201cSome people say, \u2018I\u2019m seeing iyawos everywhere,\u2019\u201d said Y., a 22-year-old urban studies major at Barnard, who was crowned Oshun when she was only 8, right before emigrating from Cuba to the US with her mother. Y., who isn\u2019t a part of any particular close-knit Orisha community in New York, grew up in Miami and hasn\u2019t found an ile like Rudy\u2019s, though she\u2019s not sure she\u2019s seeking that. Her ties remain strong to Regla, a suburb of Havana, where her uncle, a babalawo, conducts the rituals that carry her through the vicissitudes of her life, both ordinary and significant. \u201cBefore,\u201d Y. said, \u201cyou really wouldn\u2019t be seeing too many people dressed all in white walking the city.\u201d Once aware of their presence, it\u2019s impossible to miss them in their sparkling white head-to-toe ensembles around New York. \n\u201cThe white is never dingy; it\u2019s crisp white \u2014 you have to have a new set of whites for everything,\u201d Lawrence said, explaining that initiation is a symbolic rebirth through \u201cmarriage\u201d to an Orisha, traditionally entailing a year of celibacy if the iyawo is unmarried. Often an iyawo will have had their crowning ritual in a botanica\u2019s subterranean ceremonial space. \n\u201cI was a skeptic,\u201d Y. told me about her relationship to Santeria as a biracial Cuban immigrant child in the US. \u201cI was radically against it.\u201d But getting older and being inserted into a very different racial landscape at Barnard, and in New York City in general, from her early years in Miami made her realize how precious her religious heritage is and how nostalgic she was for its philosophies and practices. She spoke of times when she\u2019s had cotton, honey, coconuts, and cacao poured over her head for cleansing. \u201cSeriously, when I have that ceremony, if I say I want something, in a week it appears \u2014 it\u2019s so crazy,\u201d she said, while acknowledging that the sacrificing of animals in other rites is controversial. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to people who are not used to it. I don\u2019t think that will ever go away.\u201d With Santeria, Y said, she encounters \u201ca magic that gets shit done.\u201d ID: 9600485 \nWhile she described the healing her babalawo uncle does as similar to reiki and energy work in that it involves purifying white light and aims to raise the vibration of those who come to see him, she nonetheless drew the distinction clearly. \u201cThe rich, white vegan as an audience for New Age spirituality, they have different spiritual needs, and they go into spirituality to serve them in different ways,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who have come out of prison finding something in Santeria, and finding a padrino who believes in them and who saves them and gives them a framework for becoming a better person, a more righteous person, that\u2019s a different kind of character change.\u201d \nY. still has her feet in both realms but clarified that they have discrete functions in her life. The New Age spaces give her a lot of feel-good and sweet experiences \u2014 but with Santeria, she said, she encounters \u201ca magic that gets shit done.\u201d \nThrough the days I camped out on the dingy-tiled top floor of the botanica and the evenings spent in the concrete vault below, the \u201cmagic\u201d was elusive and a word that never came up. What was readily apparent was that those who opened up to the energy of the Orishas, who chose to believe, had done so because they were reaching, very simply, for the best in themselves. With a nudge from Rudy, they discovered a kind of alchemy of their deepest selves, a way to unlock the potential to rise from the dross of human existence. \n\u201cFor everybody it\u2019s for something reason,\u201d Rudy said in his hidden back nook, where a stainless steel bowl lay overturned on the sodden, crooked floor. \u201cAlways faith,\u201d he added, with the gentle reminder that it\u2019s not all tragedy and woe: \u201cWe need faith because of something, eh? We\u2019re wanting something for that faith. We want prosperity, we want a job, we want a good life, to get married, good things for children.\u201d \nIn his world, the mysticism around Santeria, whether tied to the seemingly ineradicable association of African religions with death curses and satanic cults or the quixotic notion of godly spirits heeding our wishes or something else, evaporated. Through the words of his godchildren, the line between magic and faith blurred, which is what he had been getting at all along. For Rudy Guardiola, being a santero, convincing people to take hold of the faith that lay dormant inside of them \u2014 the unshakeable belief that they have abundance even in lack, the unbreakable core that even the most persistent and pernicious structural inequities cannot touch \u2014 has been his greatest fortune. \nThough his legacy as well as the spiritual roots that define it will endure, the question of how and where is like a shadow that chases Orisha worship. New York\u2019s aggressive gentrification, our modern-day colonialism, keeps at the heels of the few visible havens that Santeria calls home in the city. And next door at Italo\u2019s, Justin said the plan is to expand the caf\u00e9 into the shop\u2019s space in a few years. \nDespite the changes throughout the block and elsewhere, Justin\u2019s forecast was news to Rudy, who was adamant that he\u2019s not moving or selling, even when the time comes that the Orishas finally give him the green light to retire. Instead, he plans to pass the botanica onto one of his godsons. In fact, months later, it was not the botanica that had disappeared but Italo\u2019s, its glass front taped up with \u201cRETAIL SPACE FOR LEASE\u201d posters and a sheet of looseleaf hanging in a corner of the window advertising the sale of its furniture and decor. \nFor Rudy, his dream is to lift the curtain on Santeria just a little. He may not have been around during the time of Pancho Mora and when Afro-Cuban drummers used music as the vehicle to bring Orisha tradition to the masses, but his hopes for the future hint to the synchronicity of kindred souls. He stands firm in his belief about what the faith and its followers deserve: to be held in their wholeness and humanity, to be heard, to be celebrated. \n\u201cMy mind is that I want to get a big hall in Manhattan to show religion, to play tambor, all the singing groups, all the drumming groups, there\u2019s maybe like 10, bring them together,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody see, and people dancing. The dance of the religion. And show everybody that part.\u201d\u2022 Marlon Krieger for BuzzFeed News ID: 9599798"], "CBSNews.com": ["  \nUS: CBS News \nFound: Mon Sep 05 05:46:14 2016 PDT\nWebpage: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/240-backyard-m...

CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid joins CBS N with more detail... \nThe high court sidestepped the right to sue argument, but upheld the lower court decision on the merits of the lawsuit. \nSeveral other states will have marijuana initiatives on the ballot come November. \nCalifornia, Maine and Nevada will ask voters whether they'd like to legalize recreational marijuana . \nThe Golden State has been a leader in cannabis culture and policy. California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana 20 years ago. Soon, it could become the fifth and largest state to approve recreational use, with an initiative on the ballot for voters this November. \nCalifornia's medical marijuana industry is already worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Experts say that number would reportedly more than double if recreational use is allowed. \nAs the country 's most populous state and the world's sixth largest economy, passing this legislation could encourage other states to follow and pressure the federal government to confront the issue, reported CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. \n(c) 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

It is expected ... \nA hurricane warning was in effect for Florida's Big Bend from the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. And on the East Coast, a tropical storm warning was issued for an area extending from Marineland, Florida, northward to the South Santee River in South Carolina. \nOvernight in Sarasota, voluntary evacuations were underway, CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca reports. Emergency crews navigated through waist-deep water looking for anyone possibly trapped. \n\"Officers were actually, they were coming up to me and their gun belts are underwater,\" Sarasota Police Lt. Lori Jaress said before gesturing to her stomach. \"They are actually up to here in water.\" \nPlay Video CBS Evening News \nForecasting three major storms in Hawaii, Florida \nChief meteorologist Eric Fisher of CBS Boston station WBZ is tracking Tropical Storm Hermine, as well as two hurricanes nearing Hawaii. \nGeorgia's governor declared a state of emergency for 56 counties through Saturday, in anticipation of high water and strong winds. \nIn Florida, Gov. Rick Scott said at a news conference that authorities expect strong storm surge, high winds, downed trees and power outages when Hermine comes ashore either later Thursday or early Friday. He urged residents to take precautions immediately - moving to inland shelters if necessary - and ensuring they have sufficient food, water and medicine. \n\"This is a life- threatening situation,\" Scott said. \"It's going to be a lot of risk. Right now, I want everybody to be safe.\" \nPlay Video CBS Evening News \nTropical Storm Hermine hits Florida's coast \nGusting winds were the first sign of Tropical Storm Hermine's approach to the west coast of Florida Wednesday. The storm is expected to make land... \nScott added that 6,000 National Guard members in Florida are ready to mobilize after the storm passes. \nHermine's maximum sustained winds Thursday afternoon were near 70 mph. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Hermine was likely to strengthen into a Category 1 hurricane by the time it lands in Florida on Thursday night or early Friday. \nAs of 1 p.m. EDT Thursday, Hermine was centered about 190 miles west of Tampa, Florida, and was moving north-northeast near 14 mph. \nResidents in some low-lying Florida communities were being asked to evacuate Thursday as the storm approached. The Tallahassee Democrat reported that emergency management officials in Franklin County have issued a mandatory evacuation notice for people living on St. George Island, Dog Island, Alligator Point and Bald Point. Residents in other low-lying, flood-prone areas were also being asked to evacuate. \nTropical Storm Hermine is shown over the Gulf of Mexico in this GOES East satellite image captured Sept. 1, 2016. \nNASA/Handout via Reuters \nScott ordered state government offices in 51 counties to close at noon Thursday. The order included the state capital of Tallahassee, home to tens of thousands of state workers. The city, roughly 35 miles from the coast, has not had a direct hit by hurricane in 30 years. \nThe last hurricane to strike Florida was Hurricane Wilma, which entered the state from along the southwest Gulf Coast as a major Category 3 storm on Oct. 24, 2005. It swept across the Everglades and struck highly-populated south Florida, causing five deaths in the state and an estimated $23 billion in damage , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \nResidents were out in force Thursday morning preparing for the storm and stores were already running low on bottled water and flashlights. City crews were struggling to keep up with demand for sand with sandbags. \nFlooding is expected across a wide swath of the Big Bend area, which has a mostly marshy coastline. Florida's Big Bend area extends from just east of the Apalachicola River in the Panhandle to roughly the Cedar Key area, west of Gainesville. It's made up of mostly rural communities and smaller cities away from Interstate 10 and Interstate 75. \nOn Cedar Key, a small island, about a dozen people were going from storefront to storefront putting up shutters and nailing pieces of plywood to protect businesses from the wind. \nOne of them, Joe Allen, spray painted on plywood in large black letters: \"Bring it on, Hermine.\" Despite the bravado, he said, \"I'm worried. You can never fully protect yourself from nature.\" \nChris Greaves and family members stopped in Tallahassee to pick up sandbags for his garage and the church they attend. \nGreaves said he lived in South Florida when Hurricane Andrew devastated the region in 1992. While he doesn't expect the same kind of widespread damage , he isn't taking any chances. \nHe said tropical weather is \"nothing to mess with,\" adding \"you still take precautions.\" \nIn South Carolina, news outlets reported that high school football games in many areas will be played Thursday night because Hermine was expected to bring heavy rains to the state Friday. \nIn Charleston County, emergency officials have a message for residents: Stay home on Friday. The storm is expected to flood streets in the Charleston area which can see high tide flooding even on sunny days. \n(c) 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

But this episode showed when the starship crew was falling apart - blighted by a virus that provokes irrational and highly emotional behavior among those infected, putting the entire ship in jeopardy. Most memorable was Sulu\u2019s turn as a swashbuckling fencer, foiled by a Vulcan nerve pinch.

While the plot is not all that great, Mudd, as played by Carmel, is a delight - so much so that he returned in a later episode, on a planet filled with beautiful female robots.

That is especially important when confronted by a gigantic (and I mean GIGANTIC) spaceship whose captain threatens you with annihilation. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cBalance of Terror\u201d \nFirst aired: December 15, 1966 \nIt was in this episode (inspired by a World War II submarine thriller, \u201cThe Enemy Below\u201d) that we learn a bit of Vulcan history, with the Enterprise encountering a Romulan warship. The Romulans have attacked several Federation outposts near the Neutral Zone, but have never been seen, before a transmission is intercepted, revealing that Romulans look just like Vulcans! As crewmembers question the loyalty of First Officer Spock (whose ancestors have blood ties to Romulans), Kirk must play cat-and-mouse with the alien ship (which is hidden by a cloaking device) before it can retreat back into Romulan territory. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cShore Leave\u201d \nFirst aired: December 29, 1966 \nSci-fi author Theodore Sturgeon penned this memorable tale of a planet where people\u2019s thoughts and memories suddenly appear in the flesh. Alice and the White Rabbit? A samurai? A knight on horseback? A World War II fighter plane? When crewmembers on shore leave start dying, Kirk has to get to the bottom of it. The answer? As Spock would say, \u201cfascinating.\u201d Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cTomorrow Is Yesterday\u201d \nFirst aired: December 29, 1966 \nIn \u201cThe Naked Time\u201d an experiment involving anti-matter threw the Enterprise back in time, by a matter of days. In this episode, an encounter with a black hole plunges the Enterprise back to 20th century Earth, where it is seen by an Air Force pilot scrambled to track the UFO. Beamed aboard the Enterprise, Captain John Christopher (Roger Perry) is distraught that he can\u2019t be returned (he\u2019s already seen too much). But then the effects of potentially changing future history by his absence have to be weighed - and Kirk finds there is no easy solution.

They are in thrall to their omniscient leader, Landru, and seek to absorb anyone who is \u201cnot of the body.\u201d The climactic reveal became something of a tired fixture in \u201cStar Trek\u201d (in which an all-powerful being is shown to actually be a robot, a computer, or a testy little kid). But a shot of the townspeople collectively stooping to pick up rocks - the better to \u201cgreet\u201d their visitors - is chilling.

Turns out they are genetically-modified beings responsible for Earth\u2019s Eugenics War. Their leader, Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban), is awakened from hibernation, which is a bad idea - he frees his followers and tries to take over the Enterprise. \nWhat was a nifty one-off episode would inspire the best of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d movies, 1982\u2019s \u201cStar Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,\u201d when Khan and his people, living in exile on a desert planet, commandeer a passing ship and hunt down the man responsible for their plight: James T. Kirk! Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cThe Devil in the Dark\u201d \nFirst aired: March 9, 1967 \n\u201cStar Trek\u201d did not go in much for horror, and used the ugly-alien-monster-that-must-be-killed trope less than other sci-fi series. But this tale of a mining colony where workers are attacked and killed by a mysterious creature was both an engrossing encounter with an unknown threat, and a story of learning to co-exist with other creatures, even those whose appearance may be repellent (and that\u2019s how the alien Horta views humans). Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cThe City on the Edge of Forever\u201d \nFirst aired: April 6, 1967 \nThe hands-down best episode of \u201cStar Trek\u201d is a riveting tale of time travel and altered history. When McCoy steps through a time portal back to Depression-era Earth, he saves the life of a peace activist in a traffic accident. That good deed unfortunately allows the Nazis to triumph during World War II, altering the course of history, and threatening the very existence of the Enterprise crew. Following McCoy, Kirk realizes that to set things right, the very woman he has fallen for back in the 1930s must die. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cAmok Time\u201d \nFirst aired: September 15, 1967 \nVulcan biology - as in the need to mate every seven years, or die - makes it imperative for Kirk to risk his professional career to get Spock back to his home planet, and to the young bride to whom his first officer had been betrothed. But Vulcan traditions about marriage and procreation are much more complicated, especially when the bride is allowed to choose a champion to fight her intended to the death - a contest that pits Spock against Kirk! Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cMirror, Mirror\u201d \nFirst aired: October 6, 1967 \n\u201cEvil twins\u201d became a mainstay of TV pop culture, allowing actors to play \u201cbad\u201d versions of their characters. Here, a transporter malfunction sends Kirk, McCoy, Uhuru and Scotty into a parallel universe, but one in which the Federation is an evil empire, with starship crews employing assassination as a form of career advancement. Will Kirk, etc. survive, or will \u201cevil Spock\u201d have the last laugh? Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cThe Doomsday Machine\u201d \nFirst aired: October 20, 1967 \nGuest star William Windom gives a terrific performance as Commodore Matt Decker, commander of the USS Constellation, who witnessed his entire crew destroyed by a giant, planet-eating machine.

When an assassin murders one of the traveling dignitaries, the investigation opens the wounds of a father-son relationship, leading to a kind of reconciliation.

An interstellar salesman\u2019s pet tribbles - purring balls of fur that love to multiply - become a real pain for Kirk, who also has to deal Klingon saboteurs, obnoxious space diplomats, and crew members who brawl in bars. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cA Piece of the Action\u201d \nFirst aired: January 12, 1968 \nAnother humorous episode - and it is heartening to know that old gangster movies would be familiar to 23rd century space travelers like Kirk, who spouts the patois of James Cagney. Unlike other developing alien worlds which must be protected from knowledge about the Federation via the Prime Directive (so as not to taint them), the \u201cgangsters\u201d on Sigma Iotia II are fully aware of outside civilizations - they\u2019ve designed their entire culture on a book, \u201cChicago Mobs of the Twenties,\u201d brought there by an Earth ship 100 years earlier. When Kirk, Spock and McCoy beam down to the planet, they find a mob boss who wants to trade up from Tommy guns to phasers, leaving Kirk to sell the Federation\u2019s protection racket. After all, Sigma Iotia II is a nice planet - you wouldn\u2019t want something to happen to it. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cThe Immunity Syndrome\u201d \nFirst aired: January 12, 1968 \nAn entire ship manned by Vulcans is destroyed, creating a psychic blow that hits Spock hard. But he recovers enough to then investigate the cause of that destruction: a giant, single-cell organism that is eating away at space, destroying worlds and threatening the entire galaxy. It was one threat that didn\u2019t have to be reasoned with, tricked, negotiated with, seduced or tackled in a fistfight - just destroyed (if possible). Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cBread and Circuses\u201d \nFirst aired: March 15, 1968 \nWhat is that member of the crew of the SS Beagle doing in a mysterious TV broadcast, engaged in a deadly gladiatorial fight in a Rome that never fell? Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate, and find the society on the planet Magna Roma mirroring the glories of ancient Rome, but with the technological advances of 20th century Earth, such as color television. Some clever satire on the fickleness of TV programming, as the Enterprise officers are forced to fight before the cameras, but also a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-like twist, when the rebellious Children of the Sun are revealed to worship something other than that star in the sky. Credit: Paramount Television \n\u201cThe Enterprise Incident\u201d \nFirst aired: September 27, 1968 \nIn a deft bit of intergalactic espionage and military brinkmanship, the Enterprise enters the Neutral Zone, only to be surrounded by three Romulan ships. Kirk and Spock are brought before the Romulan commander, whereupon Spock outs Kirk as having intentionally intruded on Romulan space. Or did he?

Never mind the monotony of their faceoff as the Enterprise crew watches, helpless, to see whether Kirk will be victorious, sparing their lives from the alien referee forcing the two ships\u2019 captains to duke it out, \u2018cause he can. Kirk ultimately downs the slow-moving Gorn by mixing mineral deposits he comes across to make gunpowder, conveniently recalling the chemical composition of something which had been out of use for at least 200 years. And when Kirk refuses to kill the Gorn, everyone\u2019s lives are spared, proving humans are more compassionate than the higher life forms that toy with us for their own amusement.

The trend comes as a growing number of states are changing laws to legalize medical, and to a lesser extent, recreational marijuana , which may be playing a role in public perception of the drug . \n\"Understanding patterns of marijuana use and dependence, and how these have changed over time is essential for policy makers who continue to consider whether and how to modify laws related to marijuana and for health-care practitioners who care for patients using marijuana ,\" study author Dr. Wilson M. Compton of the National Institute on Drug Abuse , part of the National Institutes of Health, said in a statement. \nPlay VideoCBSN \nFederal government won't loosen up on marijuana restrictions \nA petition to loosen restrictions on marijuana use has been rejected by the DEA . CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid joins CBS N with more detail... \nFor the study, Comptom and his team analyzed data from 596,500 adults aged 18 or older who took part in an annual, nationally-representative government survey from 2002 to 2014. \nThe participants were asked questions about whether or not and how often they used marijuana ; first-time marijuana use ; and whether they had a marijuana use disorder. They were also asked their views about the drug and state legalization of marijuana use for medical purposes. The study period concluded before Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska legalized marijuana for recreational use. \nThe results showed that marijuana use - which was defined as having used marijuana any time in the previous year - rose from 10.4 percent of adults in 2002 to 13.3 percent in 2014. \nWhen extrapolated to the whole U.S. population, that means the overall number of marijuana users increased from an estimated 21.9 million people in 2002 to 31.9 million in 2014. \nThe report also found that about 1.4 million adults first started using marijuana in 2014, up from about 823,000 first-time users in 2002. \nAnd in what Compton called a somewhat surprising finding, the number of daily or almost-daily marijuana users rose from 3.9 million in 2002 to 8.4 million 2014. \n\"This translates to a more than doubling of the number of adults using marijuana daily or near daily,\" Compton told CBS News. \nThe growing number coincided with a decrease in the proportion of people perceiving \"great risk of harm \" from smoking marijuana once or twice a week. Half of Americans surveyed expressed that concern in 2002, but it dropped to 33 percent in 2014. \nThese trends - increasing marijuana use , and decreasing perception of harm - generally began in 2007. \nPlay VideoCBS This Morning \nHow Calif. vote for recreational pot could change national debate \nThe campaign to legalize recreational marijuana is officially underway in California. A similar ballot initiative failed in 2010, but a recent po... \nThe prevalence of marijuana abuse or dependence among adults in the general population remained stable at about 1.5 percent between 2002 and 2014, while the number of those with these disorders among users declined from about 15 percent to 11 percent during this time period. \nPeople who used marijuana were more likely to develop dependence if they were male, younger, had low education, were not working full-time, were depressed, and used tobacco or other substances. \nCompton said the findings have important implications for the health care system. \n\"As a clinician, I want to make sure that my medical colleagues are aware of this so that they begin to ask their patients more routinely about use of marijuana ,\" Compton said, \"because if you don't ask people won't necessarily tell you about it, and yet it could interact with medical treatments that you have in mind or conditions that you're treating.\" \nIn an accompanying editorial, Professor Wayne Hall of the University of Queensland in Australia points out that changes in the prevalence of marijuana use occurred during a period when many states legalized the drug for medicinal use, but before four states went on to legalize it for recreational use. Therefore, he argues, continued monitoring is needed as the legislative and social landscape regarding the drug continue to shift. \n\"It is probably too soon to draw conclusions about the effects of these legal changes on rates of cannabis use and cannabis related harms , but it is likely that these policy changes will increase the prevalence and frequency of cannabis use and, pot entially, cannabis use disorders in the longer term,\" he writes. \n(c) 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
