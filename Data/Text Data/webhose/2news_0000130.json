According to filings with the Federal Election Commission , Trump on Friday wired $10 million to his campaign, adding to the relatively paltry sum in the neighborhood of $30,000 that he had contributed previously.

Bernie Sanders tirelessly tried to make hay out of the fact that the former Secretary of State would not release transcripts of paid speeches she had delivered to Wall Street audiences. Clinton repeatedly insisted she would release them if and when all the candidates running from both parties made the same disclosures. \nBut now that the primaries are over and Clinton and Trump are last major candidates standing, her position would not seem to hold up to review . Of course, WikiLeaks may have done the job for her: Earlier this month they released what were purported to be excerpts from those speeches. \nProof of Melania Trump's citizenship status — As the Slovenia-born Melania Trump began to draw more scrutiny as a potential first lady, questions started to be raised about how she obtained her citizenship status. \"She has got it so documented,\" Trump insisted back in August. He pledged to hold a press conference that would provide detailed information to quell rumors about her background.

No timing details https://t.co/qGqDIbHRQf — Jeremy Diamond (@JDiamond1) August 9, 2016 \nBut that much discussed press conference never took place. Melania Trump did eventually share a letter on social media from her attorney claiming that she never worked in the U.S. in 1995, which would have been prior to her officially obtaining a work visa. But skeptics still believe the matter is yet to be settled because no definitive proof was attached to the denials. \nEvidence to refute Donald Trump's accusers — After a group of women (now 12 ) recently came forward to accuse Trump of past sexual assaults, the candidate and his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, promised to release evidence that would discredit all of them. Initially, Trump said this evidence would come out in the \"appropriate way and at the appropriate time.\" But later, Pence went even further, promising detailed rebuttals \"before the day is out\" — that was on Oct. 14. \"Before the day is out, there will be evidence that calls into question these [sexual assault] allegations\" - Pence https://t.co/qWfYTaATS6 pic.twitter.com/pnat6m8rF0 — CBS News (@CBSNews) October 14, 2016 \nBut with the exception of one alleged witness (whose reliability has been seriously questioned) to an incident that was supposed to have taken place on an airplane more that 35 years ago, the Trump campaign has not produced anything to prove his accusers demonstrably false. \nAlthough Trump has said that all of the allegations have been \"debunked,\" the reality is that it will very much be his word against his accusers' for the foreseeable future. \nRepublican plan to expand the electoral map — The Trump campaign prides itself on keeping many of its major policy proposals close to the chest. They have a \"secret\" plan to defeat ISIS. They have a \"beautiful\" replacement for Obamacare. But one of the most curious assertions yet to be supported by concrete data is Trump's insistence during the GOP primaries that he could put dark blue states like New York, California, New Jersey and Connecticut in play . \nWhile Trump did dominate Republican primary contests in most of the traditionally Democratic-leaning states, and his unconventional background and politics might make him uniquely appealing to previously untapped constituencies for the GOP, he has consistently performed like a traditional red state candidate in places like New York and California. \nEven his campaign's own battleground map concedes that the biggest blue strongholds from the last two and half decades are off the table. Could it be that Trump is acknowledging he can't win everywhere?
