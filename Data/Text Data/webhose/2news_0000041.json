He said it's time for conservative Hispanics to \"fix\" the GOP. \nMonty made the projection in a Facebook invitation to 270 people for an Oct. 19 gathering in Las Vegas, the same day and in the same city as the last presidential debate. \n\"As we approach what appears to be yet another defeat of the GOP presidential candidate by a left leaning democrat (sic), it is incumbent on Latino conservatives to come together to fix our Party (sic) so that we can capture more Latino votes,\" Monty wrote in the Facebook posting. \nMonty warned that unless the the number of Latinos increases \"the GOP will cease to be a national party.\" \n\"As we face our third loss, in twelve (12) years, the same issues that hamstrung us in 2008 remain, and have essentially grown stronger,\" Monty stated.

But Monty and other Latinos dumped Trump and quit his Hispanic advisory council after Trump recommitted to mass deportations and to a pledge to make Mexico pay for a border wall in an Aug. 31 speech in Arizona. \nRELATED: GOP Hispanics Dump Trump After Arizona Immigration Speech \nReached by phone, Monty was a little less resolute about a coming White House race loss for the GOP, but definitely doubtful of his party's chances. \n\"Probably Hillary is going to win. We need to be prepared for that,\" he told NBC Latino. \"None of us has an Ouija board, but that's the way I see it. That's the way all the founders of the Latino Conservative Conclave see it.\" Play Donald Trump recommits to mass deportation following Mexico trip 3:20 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/755792451618\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nIn addition to finding ways conservative Latinos can \"fix\" the party, the race for chairmanship of the Republican Party also will be discussed, he said. Former GOP presidential contender Carly Fiorina has been prepping for a run at the post, according to reports. \nAfter Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 presidential election, the GOP conducted an \"autopsy\" of the party and concluded its survival hinged, in part, on drawing in more Latinos. The party said to do that in needed to embrace and champion immigration reform. \n\"If Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence,\" the autopsy stated. \nTrump started his campaign by blasting Mexico and asserting it \"sends\" Mexicans to the United States who are rapists and criminals and bring drugs. He called a federal judge born in the U.S. a Mexican and questioned his ability to be fair in presiding over a lawsuit against Trump. \nAs a result, a number of Hispanics in the GOP have refused to back Trump. Even if he wins, Monty said, \"we are not going to let up\" on the biggest impediment to drawing Hispanics to the party, immigration. Some 75 percent or more of all Latinos have a negative view of Trump, according to polls. \nMonty said the conservative Latinos group will look for ways to add stiff language to the party platfortm that specifically \"disavows\" mass deportations. \n\"We can't have a party that puts stuff like that (mass deportations) in a platform, supports a candidate like this and wants to roll us out for Hispanic Heritage Month,\" he said. \nNot everyone participating shares Monty's bleak view. Jerry Natividad, a businessman in Colorado and Trump surrogate, said with two debates left, \"more information to be exposed and policy discussed\" a Trump win still is possible. \nHe said he's not enamored with Trump, Trump was never his first choice and he's troubled by some of the things but believes he's the best chance for changing corruption in Washington, D.C.

The reason they give is the Trump people are here to stay and if you have any political ambition jump on the Trump train now or there may be backlash in the future,\" he said. \nBut he said he's not worried about that. \n\"My heart is in building a majority coalition for the future so we can be a competitive national brand from the top down on the ticket,\" Muniz said. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
