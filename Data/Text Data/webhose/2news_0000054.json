Hombre in Spanish means man, but Trump's pronunciation made it sound like \"hambres.\" The word for hunger in Spanish is hambre . — Karen Scian (@karenscian) October 20, 2016 The best way to fight #badhambres is with #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner . #Debatenight — Ilmi Granoff (@theilmatic) October 20, 2016 I hear the bathrooms in Trump Tower are being relabeled \"Bad Hombres\" and \"Nasty Women.\" — George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 20, 2016 \nAnd the Clinton campaign seized on it as it had done during the vice presidential debate with #ThatMexicanThingAgain. The web address badhombres.org redirects to a donor page. \nThe reference came up when moderator Chris Wallace asked Clinton and Trump to defend their plans on immigration. Both reverted to familiar themes. \nTrump went with the border wall, victims of crimes committed by people here illegally and the pledge that he would deport the \"bad hombres.\" \nRELATED: Will Immigration Get Its Due in Final Clinton Trump Debate? \nClinton raised the issue of splitting families and blasted Trump's mass deportation plan. She also vowed to work on immigration reform in her first 100 days, which was quickly picked up on social media. \nBut just short of 10 minutes into their discussion on immigration, the candidates pivoted to Russia and Vladimir Putin. \nThe scant attention the election-dominating topic got was noted by online audiences. disappointed at how little these debates have mentioned #immigration tonight was not enough — Gabriela Cid (@Cid_Price) October 20, 2016 \nAlthough it's a topic that has loomed large over this year's election, the confounding complexities of the topic have not been hashed over to any great degree in the previous debates and weren't once again Wednesday night. \nThe candidates seemed on the verge of a more insightful discussion when Clinton explained the need to bring immigrants here illegally \"out of the shadows\" into the formal economy so they are not be exploited by employers who pay them lower wages and undermine American workers. That argument is one that the AFL-CIO often makes in support of immigration reform. \nAs Clinton was explaining a comment she made about dreaming of open borders in an energy speech, things began to crumble. \nThe \"open borders\" remark came to light when Wikileaks posted a transcript of a speech she'd made online. Clinton said that the transcript was obtained through espionage by Russians, a reference to Russian hacking of computer systems. \n\"That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders,\" Trump said.
