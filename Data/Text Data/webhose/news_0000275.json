Gary Johnson stumped on Syria question Published September 08, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print \nLibertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson was seemingly stumped Thursday morning on a fundamental question about the Syrian civil war – a stumble that comes as he tries to make his case for being included in the upcoming presidential debates. \nAsked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” what he would do about Aleppo -- the major Syrian city that has been a stronghold for opposition forces and under siege by Bashar Assad’s government -- Johnson responded: “And what is Aleppo?” \nJournalist Mike Barnicle responded, “You’re kidding.” \nJohnson said he was not, and Barnicle explained, “Aleppo is in Syria. … It’s the epicenter of the refugee crisis.” \n“Okay, got it,” Johnson said, and went on to call Syria a “mess.” \nThe battle for Aleppo has become increasingly complex. According to Reuters, Iraqi Shiite militia members are preparing to join, while opposition forces battle Assad’s military for control. Assad’s regime was recently accused of another chlorine gas attack in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. 2016 Election Headquarters \nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.
