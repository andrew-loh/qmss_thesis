He is totally correct. Trump's immigration speech was his best speech to date. He appeared presidential in a way Hillary Clinton can never appear due to the scandals that continue to follow her on her careless use of a personal server and now the indication of pay to play of the Clinton Foundation/Clinton Secretary of State. Trump is correct, he called out the consequences of Obama's and now Clinton's open border policies. He stood up for the American people against the liberal elites. Let's take OUR America back. Vote Trump/Pence in November!", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T09:28:03.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
