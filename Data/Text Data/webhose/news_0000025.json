Meanwhile, about 1,200 new members joined online. \nEven though the church has seen a steady decline in membership in recent decades, that's by far the biggest monthly loss in recorded history. \nThe Church of Norway counted about 3.8 million members in 2015, about 73 percent of the population. \nLike neighboring Sweden and Denmark, Norway is among the most secular countries in the world. In all three Scandinavian countries, membership in the main Lutheran church is falling, while Catholic and Islamic communities are growing, mainly due to immigration.
