She tells The Virginian-Pilot (http://bit.ly/2cCtGBk ) that the agency ended its relationship with the jail because it \"could not verify the facility's compliance\" with standards that ensure detainees are in a safe, secure and humane environment. \nVirginia Attorney General Mark Herring has asked federal officials to investigate the jail after the high-profile deaths of two inmates, including a mentally ill 24-year-old, who died months after being jailed for stealing $5 worth of junk food. \nNorfolk Sheriff Bob McCabe is the jail's interim superintendent. He says a communication problem contributed to ICE's decision to leave. \n___ \nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-17T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-16T19:36:59.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
