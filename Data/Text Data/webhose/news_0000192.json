A modest number have been exempted from deportation because of an Obama administration action but most live under the risk of being removed from the country. \nVeterans are guaranteed government health care and because almost all are citizens, the right to vote and other government benefits. \nThe quality of their care has been criticized by Trump and others but people in the country illegally do not have equivalent rights to health care, except for emergency treatment. Public hospitals are required to provide emergency medical care regardless of immigration status. \n___ \nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at the Phoenix Convention Center, Wednesday, Aug. 31, 2016, in Phoenix.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) \nTRUMP: \"When politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following: amnesty, open borders, lower wages ... It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\" \nTHE FACTS: No politician of either party who supports overhauling immigration laws supports \"amnesty,\" but the meaning of \"amnesty\" varies depending on who is talking. \nThe sweeping and bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate in 2013 was derided by opponents as amnesty, but supporters including GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida disputed that, noting numerous requirements imposed on immigrants in the country illegally along a 13-year path to citizenship, including paying penalties. \nThe bill proposed spending tens of billions of dollars to double the number of border patrol agents and greatly increase border security. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied the bill and projected that it would lower wages for the entire workforce slightly over the first 10 years after becoming law, but would then increase wages for the entire workforce by even more, at the same time boosting economic output and increasing the GDP. \n___ \nTRUMP, on the number of people in the U.S. illegally: \"Our government has no idea. It could be 3 million, it could be 30 million. They have no idea.\" \nTHE FACTS: The government actually has an idea. The Homeland Security Department estimates there are 11.4 million people in the United States illegally. Few in the immigration debate challenge that estimate. \nThe figure comes from an analysis of the most recent Census Data. The government compares the number of people whom the Census reports as foreign-born with the number of people who have been admitted legally and gained citizenship. The most recent estimate dates to January 2012. It roughly matches the estimates of demographers from the Pew Foundation, which issues its estimates more rapidly than the government. \nExperts believe the number of people in the U.S. illegally has been steadily declining as Mexicans and others return to their home country and illegal border crossings dwindle. \n___ \nTRUMP, on ending the practice of releasing people who are caught crossing the border illegally, pending a court appearance: \"We are going to end catch-and-release ... Under my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\" \nTHE FACTS: Many of the releases in question were ordered by courts. They were not a policy of the Obama administration. \nA federal judge in Los Angeles ruled last year the federal government's detention of children and their mothers who were caught crossing the border illegally violated a 1997 court settlement. In July, an appeals court narrowed the scope, saying children must be quickly released but not their parents. From October through July, 48,311 unaccompanied children were arrested crossing the border from Mexico; many more children were caught with their families. \nMany crossing the border illegally claim asylum, which must be adjudicated by an immigration judge. People can claim asylum because they are being persecuted or fear persecution on grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group or political opinion. \n___ \nTRUMP, after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto: \"I shared my strong view that NAFTA has been a far greater benefit to Mexico than it has been to the United States and that it must be improved upon. ... I expressed that ... we must take action to stem this tremendous outflow of jobs from our country. It's happening every day, it's getting worse and worse and worse, and we have to stop it.\" \nTHE FACTS: The loss of manufacturing jobs is generally attributed to China, not Mexico. \nSome U.S. companies have moved jobs to Mexico — the Carrier Corp. recently decided to relocate an air conditioning factory there from Indiana. But there is little data to show that the trend is getting \"worse and worse.\" \nNo reliable annual measures exist of job flows between the U.S. and Mexico. The United States hemorrhaged manufacturing jobs from 2000 to 2010, when more than 5.5 million were lost, but most economists blame the emergence of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and the increasing automation of many factories. \nRecently, manufacturing has done a bit better: Since 2010, U.S. manufacturing jobs have increased by about 900,000. And many economists credit NAFTA with helping the U.S. auto industry by providing a cheap source of parts that otherwise might have been sourced in China. A report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research argued that imports of subsidized U.S. agricultural products put as many as 2 million Mexican farmers out of work. And since NAFTA's implementation in 1994, Mexico has grown more slowly than many of its Latin American counterparts. \n___ \nTRUMP: \"We didn't discuss that. We didn't discuss who pays for the wall, we didn't discuss.\" ... \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date.\" \nPENA NIETO on Twitter, in Spanish: \"At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.\" \nTHE FACTS: The facts may depend on what your definition of a discussion is. If the Mexican president opened with a comment that his country won't pay for the wall and Trump did not respond to it, that may not have been a discussion in his mind. But the subject, it seems, came up. The Trump campaign's brief statement on the meeting did not quibble with Pena Nieto's account. It said the meeting \"was not a negotiation.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Erica Werner in Washington and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.
