But the trend reported by Google marks a large reversal from last month's registration searches, which were highest in predominantly white, Northern states – areas that typically have the highest voter turnout in presidential elections.\nThe Google search surge, however, does fit with anecdotal evidence that Trump’s language – not just toward Machado, but on topics important to Latinos such as immigration – is driving more Hispanics to register to vote this election season.\n“I’m confident Latino voter turnout will go up significantly,” Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julíán Castro told Fox News Latino during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. “We see it in the registrations that are happening in different states. I believe it can go into the 50s, and if that happens then particularly in swing states like Florida, Colorado Nevada and even Virginia, where there is a growing Latino population, Hillary Clinton will win those.”\nLatinos, however, have historically failed to show up in large numbers come Election Day.\nIn the 2012 presidential match-up between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, less than half (48 percent) of registered Latino voters cast a ballot – a figure that has remained relatively unchanged over the last four presidential elections.\n“Our weakness in this country is that in the past there have been Latinos who are eligible to vote who are not registered to vote,” said Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez of California. “The only way we’re going to get the problems in our community addressed is to increase our numbers.”\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-30T01:09:42.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
