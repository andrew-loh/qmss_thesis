Politico, in a news story , said Trump had been “playing at diplomacy in Mexico,” that his speech made clear that what happened there, “much like his campaign's two-weeks of gentle walkbacks, was a ruse.” And, for good measure, called the entire episode a “farce.” \nBut let’s take a step back. Even some of Trump’s harshest critics gave him kudos for the gamble he took in Mexico City. He appeared on the world stage with Enrique Pena Nieto, handled himself well, and both men spoke of having an open and constructive conversation.\nSure, Trump had claimed that making Mexico pay for a border wall hadn’t come up, while Pena Nieto later said he made clear his country would do no such thing. But diplomacy doesn’t mean hammering away on the most divisive issue the first time you meet a foreign leader, especially if you’re, well, not yet president.\nEvery challenger, and especially one who’s never held elective office, has to pass a commander-in-chief test. So those images were especially valuable for the billionaire outsider. And had he simply returned to Trump Tower, he would have basked in 48 hours of positive coverage.\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.

He displayed an almost unrecognizable demeanor during his afternoon in Mexico, appearing measured and diplomatic, while hours later he took the stage at his campaign rally and denounced illegal immigrants on the whole as a criminally minded and dangerous group that sows terror in communities and commits murders, rapes and other heinous violence.”\nFor the record, I don’t believe he denounced illegal immigrants “on the whole” as criminals, though he certainly played up the dangers of allowing them to stay here without being vetted and emphasized that those with criminal records would be booted out.\n(The Times piece also went through a significant rewrite after the first edition, as you can see here .) \nMuch of the press didn’t really credit Trump for dropping his mass deportation plan in favor of dealing with the non-criminals of the 11 million illegal immigrants in several years, after the rest of his plan is in place. Instead, there were observations that his base might not like the change.\nAnd while the left trashed the speech as “unhinged and demagogic,” as Salon put it, the underlying tone elsewhere was that Trump was consumed with throwing red meat to the anti-immigrant crowd, and parading relatives of those killed by illegal immigrants.\nBy yesterday, Trump was back to telling supporter Laura Ingraham on her radio show that “there’s quite a bit of softening” in his plan.\nNow there’s legitimate media criticism to be made of whether Trump was sending mixed messages at Wednesday’s twin events, and whether the speech did nothing to draw moderate voters to his cause.\nBut for a decade now, the mainstream media mindset has been in favor of modest immigration reform. That was true when George W. Bush was pushing it. It was true with the Republican “autopsy” after 2012. It was true when Marco Rubio and the Gang of 8 were trying to push a compromise measure through Congress.\nThat’s why the pundits were so surprised when Trump won the nomination after embracing such ideas as a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants. He’s playing on a bigger field now, of course, but on this issue, at least, much of the media still find his message distasteful.\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
