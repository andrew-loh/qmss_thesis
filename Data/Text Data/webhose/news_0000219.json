Proponents of toughening enforcement wanted local police officers to break from tradition and start confronting illegal immigration.\nWhen the law was passed in 2010, it touched off a national furor with supporters calling for similar legislation for their own states and detractors calling for an economic boycott of Arizona.\nIn the end, the courts barred enforcement of the law's requirement that immigrants carry registration papers. It also blocked enforcement of a provision aimed at immigrants that prohibited people blocking traffic when offering or seeking day-labor services on streets.\nAs part of the agreement, the state also agreed to pay $1.4 million in attorney fees and other costs to the coalition.\nThe coalition agreed to drop its appeal of a September 2015 lower-court decision that dismissed the coalition's challenge and concluded the law's critics failed to show police would enforce the law differently for Latinos than it would for people of other ethnicities.\nSeveral of Arizona's other immigration laws have been thrown out by the courts in recent years.\nThe state's immigrant smuggling ban was struck down in 2014 after a judge concluded it conflicted with the federal government's immigration powers.\nA voter-approved law that denied bail to immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and charged with certain crimes was thrown by an appeals court that ruled in 2014 that it violated due-process rights by imposing punishment before trial.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-16T15:29:40.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
