Here is why I say that.\nLet me first state for the record tho, I love Mexico, love her families, love the country and I also am well aware scamming is cultural along with paying off officials, and wheeling and dealing for prices. So when Trump says this \"We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate\" he is correct and that can well include our southern neighbors.\nAnd post note: Gutierrez has six children. Each one of those six children can sponsor extended family out of the country for US citizenship and permanent residency, along with Gutierrez. So for those who worry about over-population and growth issues, including natural resources , housing, water, start there.\n---\nTrump Immigration Speech-Fact Check:\nhttp://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/...\n---\nRe \"I'm going to speak as if I was still Mexican,\" said Gutierrez, who was born in Mexico...\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/la...", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/latinos-trump-founder-warns-taco-trucks-every-corner-n641976", "http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration"], "published": "2016-09-04T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-04T00:16:51.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
