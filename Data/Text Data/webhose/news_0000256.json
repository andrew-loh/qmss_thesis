Donald Trump's self-declared \"softening\" on immigration is gone, replaced by a recommitment to a hardline policy that could best be described as mass deportation. \nShouting his remarks to a fired-up crowd in Arizona, which has been home to some of the most contentious immigration policy fights of the last decade, Trump pledged a maximal approach that would target ever undocumented immigrant in the country without mercy. \n\"There will be no amnesty,\" Trump said. \"Our message to the world will be this: You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country.\" \nRelated: Trump Meets With Mexican President But Dispute Emerges Over Wall \nThe speech came just hours after Trump appeared in Mexico, where he struck a more conciliatory tone after meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. Trump's warm-up speakers Rudy Giuliani and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) wore \"Make Mexico Great Again Also\" hats. \n\"We will build a great wall along the southern border,\" Trump said in Arizona before being drowned out by cheers. \"And Mexico will pay for the wall.\" \nWhatever crisis of conscience Trump had this month after talking to Hispanic supporters and hearing tales of longtime residents torn from their families passed in the rear-view mirror. Instead, Trump used his remarks in Arizona to reassure his core supporters that he would focus on deporting criminals, but remain true to his original pledge to target all undocumented immigrants without mercy, whether illegal workers or DREAMers or the parents of U.S. citizens.
