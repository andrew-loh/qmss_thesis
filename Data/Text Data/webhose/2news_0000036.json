TexMex were born here of Mexican ancestry and the legal immigrants worked within the system to get here. \\n\nThey're hard working AMERICANS and they suffer the backlash against the illegals breaking the law. \\n\nThey also recognize that the illegals working using false identities make it harder for them to get jobs and raise their families legally. The ILLEGALS cram 20 or more people into a small one or two bedroom rental effectively having no major living expenses since they all share the rent and utilities (when they pay that) and send their 'remittances' back to South\\/Latin America. They know even they can't compete against the illegals. \\n\nWhen will the rest of society wake up and realize that?", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-28T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-28T16:31:42.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
