I look at my grandparents, who immigrated from Poland at the start of the 1900's and forbid their children from speaking anything but English in their \\\"new American\\\" household. My grandparents, by the time I came around, were able to speak English with no need for a translator, albeit with an accent. Are these \\\"new\\\" immigrants less intelligent than the \\\"old\\\" immigrants, that they can't learn the language of the country they claim they want to be a part of? Or is it a case of they claim they want to be a part of this country, but refuse to actually take on the de facto national language of this country? Many of these people didn't bother to file their naturalization papers for citizenship until the presidential elections started rolling around, even though they had been here for \\\"decades\\\". That tells me, they don't really care about being a \\\"citizen\\\", they just want to make sure our government continues pandering to the \\\"marginal\\\" immigrants and their illegal alien families and countrymen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-16T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-17T11:02:46.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
