Was that to \"escape\" gangs in their country? Or to strengthen gangs in our country? While we're at it, please explain why we allow gang members to stay. As we basically ignore immigration law completely, I guess it would do no good to amend existing law to state that if a gang member's parents entered the US illegally, any child actively involved in criminal gangs has no right to citizenship and will be deported. If found in US they automatically serve 15 years in prison.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-15T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-15T01:47:03.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
