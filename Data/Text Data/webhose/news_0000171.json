Rahami became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2011. NBC News has learned that U.S. officials didn't check his social media accounts at that time. An Obama administration official acknowledged that the Department of Homeland Security was not checking social media at that time, and only recently began a pilot program to do so. If they had checked his accounts, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC News, they would have found multiple links to radical jihadi videos. Rahami and other members of his family brought a civil discrimination suit in federal district court in 2011, alleging they were harassed for being Muslim. The dispute was about noise from the restaurant, which stayed open late, but the Rahami suit quoted the neighbors as saying, \"Muslims make too much trouble in this country.\" The suit references a previous arrest of Rahami's brother Mohammad for assaulting a police officer. Rahami visited Quetta, Pakistan, considered a high-risk area by the government, in late 2011, staying six months. He received a \"secondary inspection\" from U.S. officials on his return. Rahami, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, said he was attending a wedding and visiting family. Rahami married an Afghan national named Asia Bibi while in Quetta, according to two senior U.S. intelligence officials. Before his return to the U.S., he contacted his congressman and asked for assistance bringing his new wife to the U.S. That request was forwarded to the State Department and USCIS, a part of the Department of Homeland Security. Because she held an expired passport and was pregnant, her visa was delayed. She subsequently received a visa to enter the United States after she gave birth to a boy. She was vetted by U.S. intelligence upon granting of a visa and entry to the U.S. in 2014 as a green card holder. Back in New Jersey, according to published accounts, an ex-girlfriend with whom he had a child took out a restraining order against Rahami in 2012. He later violated the order. \nIn 2012, according to a federal criminal complaint filed against him after the Chelsea bombing, Rahami applied for and received a new U.S. passport. There was again no probe of his social media. \nRahami returned to Pakistan in April 2013 and stayed nearly a year. He lived with family in Quetta. During this time, he traveled to Turkey and Afghanistan and U.S. intelligence also believes that he traveled to Syria, attempting to join foreign fighters. His biometrics — iris and fingerprints — would have been taken on entry to Afghanistan, as has been required of all U.S. visitors since the May 2011 U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. That information is shared by the U.S., Pakistan and Afghanistan. \nWhile Rahami was in Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere in 2013 and 2014, his siblings were posting pro-jihadi comments on social media. One posted a quote from U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, the recruiter and propagandist for al Qaeda in Yemen who was killed by a U.S. air strike in September 2011. A senior intelligence official confirms the man on the right in this photo is the suspect. The photo is from his brother's Facebook page and it was taken during Ahmad's 2013 trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Facebook \nRahami's brother, the same one who was arrested for allegedly fighting with a police officer, visited Pakistan during this period. He is now believed to be living in Pakistan. \nUpon returning to the U.S. in 2014, Ahmad Rahami was required to go through secondary screening again and interviewed. According to the New York Times, his travel and interview provoked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue a TECS tip-off message to the National Targeting Center, a flag that automatically notifies authorities of any subsequent international and domestic air travel. The TECS system serves as an early warning system for officials who compile watchlists and the FBI. \nIn August 2014, Rahami was charged in New Jersey with aggravated assault and unlawful possession of a weapon and was released after posting $25,000 bail because of an alleged attack on his brother with a knife. Law enforcement and intelligence sources state that he stabbed his brother Nasim in the leg and hit his mother Najiba. He spent three days in jail. Charges were pursued, a grand jury was convened, but ultimately the victim recanted. \nAs part of the August 2014 fracas, a neighbor heard Rahami's father call him a terrorist. The neighbor told the local police, the police told the Union County prosecutors, and the prosecutors informed the Newark Joint Terrorism Task Force. When the FBI went to question the father, he said he spoke in anger and did not believe his son was a terrorist, though he was concerned that his son was hanging around with the wrong kind of people, maybe gang members. According to the official FBI statement: \"In August 2014, the FBI initiated an assessment of Ahmad Rahami based upon comments made by his father after a domestic dispute that were subsequently reported to authorities. The FBI conducted internal database reviews, interagency checks, and multiple interviews, none of which revealed ties to terrorism.\" \nFBI agents approached Ahmad Rahami as part of the inquiry, but he refused to talk to them. \nAccording to a federal criminal complaint filed against him earlier this week, and a senior intelligence official, at the time of the initial FBI probe, Ahmad -- and possibly unnamed accomplices -- had more than one YouTube channel (Yaafghankid786, among others) and designated radicalized videos as \"favorites.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-23T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-23T18:31:38.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
