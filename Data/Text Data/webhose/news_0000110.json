He began by thanking law enforcement officers and promised them that when he’s president they will get “the credit they deserve.” \nHe then pointed out what’s wrong with America’s current immigration policies. \n“We now have an open immigration system that fails to vet immigrants,” he explained. “Attack after attack, we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the U.S. puts Americans at danger.” \n“Let me state very clearly, immigration security is national security.” \nHillary Clinton, he said, has no solutions and has actually led to the problem. \n“My opponent has the most open borders policy ever,” he said. \n“You can’t have vetting if you don’t look at ideology,” Trump continued. “Hillary refuses to look at their worldview.” \nClinton is harder on his own supporters than terrorists, the GOP nominee noted. While she calls his voters “deplorable,” she gives radical Islam a free pass.
