He promised to cut off funding to \"sanctuary cities,\" immediately remove any undocumented immigrant arrested for a crime, and warned that \"no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.\" \nHillary Clinton, by contrast, has pledged to pursue legislation creating a path to citizenship for qualifying immigrants in her first 100 days in office. Failing that, she has pledged to \"go even further\" than President Obama in using executive action to shield undocumented immigrants from deportations, and pledged she would not deport children or break up families. \n\"I do not have the same policy as the current administration does,\" Clinton said during a Democratic debate in March. \"I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.\" \nTrump has said he would deport young undocumented immigrants without hesitation; Clinton has hired DREAMers to campaign jobs. Trump regularly brings parents whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants onstage at his rallies; Clinton brought undocumented immigrants onto the main stage of the Democratic National Convention in primetime. She's also said undocumented immigrants should have access to the Affordable Care Act's exchanges (though not its subsidies). Trump said in his speech Wednesday he would prioritize removing \"public charges\" who are \"straining the safety net.\" \n\"Trump really is talking about sealing off the country, closing off the border, and throwing out the key,\" David Leopold, an immigration attorney supportive of recent immigration reform efforts, told NBC News. \"It's not hyperbole.\" \nMark Krikorian, whose Center for Immigration Studies favors lower immigration levels, said Clinton had widened the gap by moving significantly to the left in recent years. \n\"These two are farther apart than any two I can remember,\" Krikorian said.

Her journey towards championing the undocumented population paralleled the Democratic Party's move as well, with interest groups like labor unions gradually moving from skeptics of immigration reform to champions. advertisement \nTrump went through his own journey as well. After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 race running on a hardline enforcement position, Trump blamed the former nominee's \"maniacal\" and \"crazy\" policy of self-deportation and suggested he might allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the country. This choice couldn't be starker. pic.twitter.com/9msdztcXbE — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 1, 2016 \nThe widening chasm comes just three years after Republicans and Democrats successfully passed a bipartisan reform bill in the Senate that would have have revised and expanded legal immigration, provided a path to citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in America today, and instituted new enforcement measures. That effort was killed in the House by a populist uprising that presaged the party's sharp turn to the right in the 2016 presidential race. \nWith the Clinton and Trump so far off now, it's an open question whether there's hope for another bipartisan effort akin to the 2013 bill or for substantial legislation in line with Trump's enforcement-only plan. advertisement \nIf Clinton fails to pass a comprehensive immigration reform package, she would still have plenty of room to act. Obama's 2014 proposal to grant temporary work permits to several million additional undocumented immigrants has been stymied by the courts, but that's because the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 this year and deferred to a lower court's decision. If Clinton appoints a new justice who decides a similar plan is legal, it could go forward. Mexico will pay for the wall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2016 \nTrump could face tougher challenges enacting his agenda on his own. While he has pledged to undo Obama's executive orders protecting DREAMers and other undocumented immigrants from deportation, he would need Congress to approve funding for his border wall, expand the number of officers deporting immigrants, and add new judges and detention centers to process their cases. \nCongress would also have to approve his proposal to institute a mandatory e-verify system to detect illegal workers as well as other security measures like a nationwide system to track visa overstays. Versions of these measures were included in the Gang of Eight bill, but it's unlikely Democrats would go along with them outside of a comprehensive package that included a path to legal status. \nSome pro-reform Republicans, Democrats, and activists have predicted a Trump loss would again send Republicans back to the negotiating table out of fear the issue was dragging down the national party. Polls have consistently shown Trump's no-exceptions deportation policy is a minority view even within his own party: 77 percent of voters backed a path to legal status over deportations in a Fox News poll this week and pluralities of Republican primary voters said the same in nearly every state with exit polls this year. \n\"Republican Party won't win WH until after some comprehensive immigration is passed & in rear window,\" former Romney strategist Stu Stevens tweeted on Thursday. \"It's math.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T12:07:44.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
