IT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT PREP YOU CAN DO ! The Bible tells us that every human has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God which is is a heart-penetrating truth. He has provided a way to cleanse us of our sins since we can never be “good enough” to cleanse ourselves. That avenue to God’s grace, mercy and forgiveness (the cleansing of our sins) is through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth Who is equally God.\nNot one of us are guaranteed a “tomorrow”. Has your time run out? Will you continue to ignore the promptings of God the Holy Spirit or have you awakened to the essential need for God, risking eternal damnation?\n​​ God the Holy Father, God the Holy Son and God the Holy Spirit are One God, the true, living, uncreated God Who is ever-present, all knowing, all powerful and all loving. He desires that every single person be forgiven, saved and to live eternally with Him. He is our only real protection and His love for you is unchanging. Accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, the true Messiah, today.\nYou can’t take your salvation for a test drive. You’re all-in or not.\nAdmit to Him that you are a sinner in need of forgiveness, that you are truly sorry for your sins. Acknowledge that He died for your sins, rose from the dead and lives forevermore. Invite Him into your life and to help you to turn from sin. Rejoice! You just became a Christian! Now trust in Him and get to know Him through the Bible which tells us everything we need to know and through prayer/talking to Him. He eagerly desires relationship with you.", "external_links": ["http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/&#8230;", "http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/706004/Donald-Trump-Mexican-people-wall-immigration-sovereign-right", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHOsVYqXwoM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dddAOwzQXDM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IUqsO26Tie4", "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-&#8230;", "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-meets-mexican-president-skips-border-wall-negotiations-n640856", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/despite-death-threats-donald-trump-will-fly-mexico-city-meet-president-nieto/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGHqQu4sGCc", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/08/donald-trump-flew-mexico-city-unmarked-plane/", "http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/7&#8230;"], "published": "2016-09-01T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T00:36:06.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
