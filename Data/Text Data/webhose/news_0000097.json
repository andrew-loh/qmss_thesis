The word Palestinian became associated with Arabs only later, when Yasser Arafat artificially created a new so-called nation of Arab \"Palestinians,\" many of whom came from and have direct relatives in neighboring countries, such as Jordan or Egypt. By 1948 enough Jewish people had returned to the land to establish the modern Jewish state of Israel. So all the world should know that there never was a \"Palestinian Arab\" state, nor even a \"Palestinian Arab\" people. They should know that all the Arabs living in the Israeli territories came from neighboring Arab states. \nThere is no such country as Palestine. ‘Palestine’ is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. ‘Palestine’ is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it.” – Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, Syrian Arab leader", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-08T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-08T16:23:24.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
