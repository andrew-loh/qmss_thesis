The controversy then faded after Clinton's health issue Sunday, which the campaign suggested was connected to a recent pneumonia diagnosis and other factors. \nBut Trump on Monday called for Clinton to go further to apologize for her \"deplorables\" comments. \n“If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full, I don’t see how she can credibly campaign any further,” he said. \n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage → \nClinton's \"deplorables\" comment follows persistent criticism of Trump for allegedly stoking racial and immigration tensions. He was roundly criticized on the day he announced his candidacy for suggesting Mexico was sending “drug dealers” and “rapists” across the southern-U.S. border.\nTrump later faced criticism for proposing a temporary ban on Muslims coming into the country, after a series of domestic and international terror attacks by Islamic radicals. But Trump has defended himself and pushed back hard Monday at Clinton's comments. \n“After months of hiding from the press, Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts,” Trump said. \nHe said Clinton \"and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh,\" but added: \"You cannot run for president if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter. You can’t lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens.”\nClinton, amid questions about her health and criticism about avoiding the press, leads the race nationally by just 3 percentage points, according to the most recent averaging of polls by RealClearPolitics.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-12T23:28:59.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
