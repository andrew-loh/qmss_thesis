She could barely reach her car.\" \nTrump, for his part, said he is \"willing to do it.\" Play Trump Calls Accuser 'Crazy Woman on the Plane' 1:10 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/786756675524\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nHis surprising claims mimicked a pro-Trump super PAC Make America Number 1 ad from last week that proposed a drug test for candidates, interspersed with sound of Clinton's coughs and imagery of her stumbling to her van on 9/11. \nThe group is bankrolled by Trump backer Robert Mercer, who donated $2 million to the PAC in July. \nThe unprecedented accusation that his opponent could have been doping before debates turned into a conversation Saturday about drugs and sentencing reform in a state with a raging heroin epidemic that Trump has taken note of before but never delved into deeply. \nIn fact, prior to Saturday's remarks, Trump had never gone further than to say that New Hampshire's idyllic terrain and landscape make it look too beautiful to be the home of a drug epidemic — nor had he ever outlined any plans for criminal justice reform. \nFewer than 25 days out from Election Day — and with no warning that a new policy was coming — Trump dove head first into the conversation. \"It's a crazy world we live in.\" \nHis drug plan, outlined for the first time Saturday afternoon, promised to stop drugs from coming into the United States by implementing his immigration plan, including a southern border wall, and closing shipping loopholes. He also said he would press the Food and Drug Administration to approve abuse-deterring drugs more quickly, complaining that they were \"too slow\" to approve these medications. \nTrump would also seek to reduce the number of prescribed opioids, like oxycodone, methadone, and fentanyl, in the United States. \n\"We have 5 percent of the world's population but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids,\" Trump said in a line that pricked the ears of reporters who once followed former GOP rival Jeb Bush and heard him give a similar message in the Granite State during his short-lived candidacy.

The cousin wrote a letter distributed by Trump's campaign discrediting the woman's claims that Trump groped her over dinner. \nTrump paraphrased the letter Saturday as an attestation that \"what she said is a lie, that she was a huge fan of Donald Trump, that she invited Donald Trump to her restaurant to have dinner — which by the way, I didn't go to … but these allegations have been, so many of them, already proven false.\" Nothing ever happened with any of these women. Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016 \nTrump's campaign had also provided an apparent witness interview to the New York Post regarding a claim by Jessica Leeds that Trump groped her on an airplane. \nOf Leeds, who Trump one day earlier disparaged on the basis of her looks, the GOP nominee called her \"crazy\" and suggested that no woman would allow themselves to be touched for 15 minutes on a plane. \nRelated: Ex-'Apprentice' Contestant Describes Trump Advances \n\"How about this: after 15 minutes, we don't know each other, after 15 minutes she said well that was too much and I decided — 15 minutes! With the ladies in this place, it would be one second, then it would be smack,\" Trump said, making a slapping motion with his hand. \n\"It's a crazy world we live in,\" he said.
