(Photo: Evan Vucci / AP via NBC News) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \n(NBC News/Alex Johnson) — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump will meet with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on Wednesday, both men said Tuesday night. \nThe Washington Post first reported Tuesday that Peña Nieto had extended invitations to both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton , to travel to Mexico City for a meeting. Several news organizations followed up with reports citing campaign operatives as saying Trump was considering the invitation. \nTuesday night, Trump cleared almost everything up by tweeting: \"I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow.\" I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2016 \nPeña Nieto shortly thereafter confirmed the information, also on Twitter: \"Mr. Donald Trump accepted that invitation and will meet tomorrow in private with President Pena Nieto.\" El Señor @realDonaldTrump ha aceptado esta invitación y se reunirá mañana en privado con el Presidente @EPN . — Presidencia México (@PresidenciaMX) August 31, 2016 \nNeither tweet said, however, whether Trump — who's already scheduled to deliver what's billed as a \"major speech\" on immigration Wednesday in Arizona — would travel to Mexico. \nTrump spoke at a rally Tuesday night in Everett, Wash., near Seattle. His didn't mention Mexico, but he has previously signaled he'd be willing to meet with Peña Nieto, who has strongly criticized Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and particularly his promise to make Mexico pay for a wall on the Mexico-U.S. border. \n\"Absolutely, I'd meet with him,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview last week. \nJennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's top spokeswoman, recalled Trump's earlier characterizations of Mexicans as \"rapists\" and \"criminals\" and said, \"What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.\" \nA senior campaign official told NBC News that \"our campaign is in a regular dialogue with the Mexican government officials\" and that Clinton is looking forward to talking with Peña Nieto again \"at the appropriate time.\" \nClinton traveled to Mexico in March 2009 to discuss joint U.S.-Mexican anti-organized crime initiatives shortly after she became secretary of state. She later met with Peña Nieto at his presidential palace in September 2014 during a speaking trip to the country. \nWednesday's meeting could be highly charged, because neither Trump nor Peña Nieto has pulled any punches when sparring over immigration. \nTrump introduced the keynote plank of his candidacy in his very first speech announcing his campaign in June 2015 : \"I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will have Mexico pay for that wall, mark my words.\" \nIn another widely criticized observation, Trump said last year: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending the best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems. \n\"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime,\" he said. \"They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards, and they're telling us what we're getting.\" \nPeña Nieto has given back as good as he's gotten. \nIn March, Peña Nieto said in an interview with the Mexican newspaper Excelsior that there was \"no scenario\" under which Mexico would pay for Trump's wall. \nAnd he went on from there: \"There have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity. \n\"That's how Mussolini got in. That's how Hitler got in. They took advantage of a situation, a problem, perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis. \n\"And I think what [they] put forward ended up at what we know today from history — in global conflagration. We don't want that happening anywhere in the world,\" he said. \nRead the full story at NBCNews.com . \nCopyright 2016 NBC News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-30T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T01:47:49.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
