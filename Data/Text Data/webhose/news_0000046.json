There's no long-term view about winning the Latino community,\" the executive director of NALEO, Arturo Vargas, told EFE in an interview.\nThe poll shows that Latinos have a better opinion of Clinton than of Trump, whose comments about immigrants are considered \"racist\" by 72 percent of Latino voters, while only 30 percent have a favorable view of the New York magnate moving into the White House.\nIn comparison, 72 percent say that Clinton has the necessary experience to be president, though they do not completely trust her.\nConclusions of the NALEO survey coincide with the concerns of other experts about the candidates' lack of empathy with Latinos in this electoral year, particularly among Democrats, who could lose the ground they won during the Obama presidency, supported by 71 percent of Hispanic voters.\n\"The electoral system in this country makes candidates focus mostly on three or four states, like Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania, but they forget to address Hispanics in the states where they have the biggest populations - Texas, California and New York,\" Vargas said.\nFor that reason he believes Hispanics might not feel sufficiently motivated to go to the polls on Nov. 8.\nBut despite everything, a record number of 13 million Hispanics are expected to take part in the electoral process this year, due to a demographic growth so great that its level of participation could possibly remain at the same percentage as in 2012.\nAccording to a study published this month by the pro-immigrant organization Latino Decisions, Trump is on his way to garnering the least support among Hispanics in the history of Republican candidacies, though the Democrats do not seem likely to capitalize on that discontent in the legislative elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-20T00:55:24.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
