O'Dell ruled this week against relief which would have allowed Crapser to remain in the United States, according to the Adoptee Rights Campaign . \nCrapser — who is the father of three young U.S. citizens — was adopted from Korea at age three, but because his adoptive parents never applied for naturalization, he is one of an estimated 35,000 intercountry adoptees who do not have U.S. citizenship and who can be deported to their country of birth — where they often do not speak the language, do not know the culture, and have no connections or family — for various minor crimes, according to advocates. \n\"Adam and his family are heartbroken at the outcome,\" Lori Walls of the Washington Immigration Defense Group, who is representing Crapser, told NBC News. \"He was eligible for a discretionary form of relief called 'cancellation of removal,' and the immigration judge decided he did not deserve this relief. Adam is desperate to be out of detention and waived appeal. He will be deported as soon as Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes the necessary arrangements.\" Adam Crapser as a child, born in South Korea and adopted by two American families who were physically and sexually abusive. Crapser is now at risk of being deported to South Korea for crimes committed in his youth because his adoptive parents did not naturalize him or give him the papers he needed to naturalize. Courtesy of Adam Crapser \n\"While I am disappointed in the judge's ruling and worried about my family's future, I hope that what has happened to me will further demonstrate the importance of passing the Adoptee Citizenship Act,\" Crapser said in a statement. \nThe Adoptee Citizenship Act of 2015 is a bill currently being considered by the U.S. Senate ( S.2275 ) and House of Representatives ( H.R.5454 ) that, if passed, would close a loophole in the Child Citizenship Act of 2000 , which automatically grants U.S. citizenship to children adopted by U.S. citizens, except for adoptees who were already over the age of 18 when the law passed in 2000. \nMany international adoptees who were not properly naturalized and also convicted of minor crimes have been deported to their country of birth, according to advocates. If passed, automatic retroactive citizenship would be granted to all international adoptees, and those who have been deported would be allowed to return to the U.S. \"We do not choose our families. But the U.S. does choose to bring adoptees into the U.S. with a promise of placing these children in safe homes to grow up like any other American.\" \n\"We are appalled by the unjust deportation of our friend and fellow adoptee who was adopted by U.S. citizens as a child and is a survivor of unspeakable abuse and trauma,\" Emily Kessel of the Adoptee Rights Campaign told NBC News. \"It is time for lawmakers to stop making excuses and pass legislation that will put an end to the deportation of Americans. Because that is what adoptees are. Americans.\" \nAdvocates for the bill argue that the bill gets at the heart of what it means to be a family and the promise of adoption. \n\"We do not choose our families,\" Kessel said. \"But the U.S. does choose to bring adoptees into the U.S. with a promise of placing these children in safe homes to grow up like any other American. Failing to grant citizenship to intercountry adoptees inhibits such individuals from fully contributing to our society and sends a negative message about our country. Adoptees are not disposable. We urge the community to call members of congress and underline the need for a legislative fix now.\" \nFollow NBC Asian America on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , and Tumblr . \nRELATED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-26T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-26T23:19:55.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
