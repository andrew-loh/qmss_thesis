The U.K. government has announced plans to begin constructing a 13-foot concrete roadside barrier at the French port of Calais, where truck drivers have been targeted by migrants trying to sneak through the Channel Tunnel. At two-thirds of a mile long, the barricade will be minuscule in comparison to Trump's proposed $8 billion, 1,000-mile fortification along the U.S.-Mexico border. And it is Britain, not France, who will pay for it. However, the plan has already earned comparisons to Trump's proposal and raises political questions about the return to Berlin Wall-era barriers to human movement. Related: Paradise Found? Migrants Spend Years Behind Bars in U.K. \"It reminds me of the wall they built around the Warsaw Ghetto in World War Two,\" said Nathalie Goulet, a French senator and vice-chair of the senate foreign affairs committee. \"Putting up walls has happened throughout history but eventually people find a way around them or they fail. Look at the Great Wall of China — now tourists walk on it and take pictures.\" Several European countries have thrown up razor wire to combat the biggest migrant crisis since World War Two. More than 305,000 migrants have entered Europe so far in 2016, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). That comes on top of the one million who reached the continent last year. While many have applied for asylum in Germany — where 1.1 million refugees arrived in 2015 — or Scandinavia, thousands more have ended up in squalid camps including a sprawling and unsanitary site in Calais known as \"The Jungle.\" Related: Migrants Trying to Reach U.K. Endure Hell of 'The Jungle' Every night, hundreds of migrants prowl the port's approach roads and freight yards, trying to sneak onto trains and trucks crossing the 30-mile English Channel by rail tunnel or ferry. Many are horribly injured as they crawl under wagons, while others suffocate in sealed or refrigerated containers. It is a daily cat-and-mouse game that tests the resilience of local police — and the patience of British and French authorities who share joint responsibility for border controls on both sides of the water. In March, the U.K. agreed to spend $22.5 million to help tighten security at the port. Last week, Immigration Minister Robert Goodwill said measures would include the... \nSource: http://nbcnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-12T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-12T19:16:34.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
