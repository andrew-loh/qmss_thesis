Clinton did say, however, that turnout was key in the election. Addressing young Latinos, Clinton said half of Latino voters are under 35 and said to young Latinos, \"We need you.\" \nThis was Obama's last speech to CHCI and his fifth as president. He also spoke in 2008 as a candidate. Clinton was at the event last year to present an award. \n\"I'm having trouble accepting this is my final trip here a president,\" Obama said.
