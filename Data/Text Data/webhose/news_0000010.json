Once they cross the U.S border they break federal law and become criminals. I see no reason why criminals should be given any special treatment. If Ms Roginsky enters Mexico without permission she would be arrested and returned or jailed. If she entered undetected and lived in Mexico for 10 to 50 years, she would still be expelled or jailed. She would not be given any food stamps, housing, medical coverage or social security. The fact immigrates invade our country and avoid detection does not forgive their illegal entry offense. The fact Obama avoids the U.S Constitution and brings in Syrians by the trainload does not make it legal or morally correct. Mr. Trump has promised to put an end to illegal immigration, return those who have violated federal law and return the trainloads of Syrians being shoved down our throats. I applaud and support this effort. We must have secure borders if we are to remain a free country. Julie Roginsky wants open borders, whereby anyone wishing to enter our country can do so. She openly invites terrorists to enter into and implode America. Whether they stay long on no, she wants all Americans to pay their freight consisting of lost jobs, unearned social security payments, unearned voting rights and unearned full medical coverage. There is one other reason why she desires trouble and that reason is because she is part of the American press. A press which feeds off bad news. Terrorism within American borders creates good press for her and those sharing her beliefs. It is this form of news which rings the cash register and keeps her job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-02T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T01:20:08.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
