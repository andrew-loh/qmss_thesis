It's worth noting that immigrants in the U.S. collectively contribute nearly $12 billion to state and local tax coffers. A 2016 report estimated that a third of undocumented immigrants are homeowners paying property tax, half of them pay income taxes, and as many as three quarters of undocumented immigrants pay into the U.S. Social Security system — an investment they will not receive a return on unless they become citizens. \nWHAT TRUMP SAID: \"President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders.\" \nTHE FACTS: Deportations have reached an all-time high under the current president, and his Priority Enforcement Program has targeted criminals and those who pose a threat to national security. \nRelated: The U.S. Already Spends Billions on Border Security \nWHAT TRUMP SAID : \"President Obama and Hillary Clinton support Sanctuary Cities, they support catch-and-release on the border, they support visa overstays, they support the release of dangerous criminals from detention — and they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\" \nTHE FACTS: The president earned praise from conservatives for changing federal policy surrounding how immigrants are prosecuted as leverage to push back against sanctuary cities. \nFor what it's worth, Trump is contradicting himself here. Over the last few weeks Trump said he wouldn't use detention centers as part of his immigration policy and would do just as past presidents have — leading many to believe he'd stick with the catch-and-release and might be open to supporting legalizing undocumented immigrants. \nWHAT TRUMP SAID: \"Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants — breaking the federal budget.\" \nTHE FACTS: The Washington Post awarded Trump's claim that Clinton would provide undocumented immigrants with Social Security four Pinocchios — it is false. Those granted deferred action through the president's immigration executive actions are not eligible for Obamacare benefits, but with a decade of work history and paid income taxes can quality for Social Security and Medicare upon retirement.
