Police found him at a Red Roof Inn on Wednesday. \nHe was expected to show up at Montgomery County [Maryland] court on Friday. At least two other MS-13 gang members were involved in the stabbing, the Post said. \nAuthorities say that the suspect “directed” the attack on Villigran-Morales, who evidently was lured into a park by a girl, Vanesa Alvarado, who suggested they might have sex. \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, said that Delgado-Perez was deported to El Salvador on October 24, 2014 and on February 26, 2015. He could be deported again, though he would likely serve his sentence first. \nMontgomery County Police Department Chief Tom Manger said that while his agency supports cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, his officers also must not be seen by the local immigrant community as quasi-immigration officials. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-10T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-11T14:14:20.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
