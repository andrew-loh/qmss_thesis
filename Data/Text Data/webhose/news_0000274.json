The same network that attacked Paris struck again in Abdeslam's hometown of Brussels in March , days after he was tracked down in his hideout and arrested. French National Police released a photo of suspect Salah Abdeslam. French National Police \nHis Brussels lawyer was present at Thursday's hearing in Paris. \nWhile Abdeslam is the only person suspected of directly participating in the attacks, others believed linked to it also are being identified as French and other European authorities continue their investigations. \nAustrian prosecutors, meanwhile, announced Thursday that two men who spent time in a Salzburg refugee camp with other suspects in connection to the attacks have been charged with being part of ISIS. \nRelated: French Defend Not Warning Bataclan Despite Threats \nA statement from the Salzburg prosecutor's office said the two are suspected of helping two other suspects who Austria extradited to France earlier this year through \"logistics as well as through gathering information and arranging contacts.\" \nThose extradited had been charged with \"the preparation of ... attacks in Paris as members of ISIS,\" according to the statement.
