First, Zika is a problem for the US because of immigration. If we had immigration control, it would not be an issue. Secondly, microcephaly is caused by any injury to the fetus during pregnancy. There are 25,000 cases per year in the US, most likely in poor communities where alcohol, tobacco and domestic abuse are more common. Zika doesn't cause microcephaly per se, and the Zika that the treasonous Democrats/Obama admin are importing will not cause the first cases of microcephaly. \n\nSecondly, the flu vaccine contains potent forms of mercury and aluminum. Not only does it not prevent the flu, it exposes your brain to two of the worst neurotoxins we know of. Vaccines are largely big pharma snake oil. They were smart and got CDC officials to push their drugs for them, and there is a revolving door between big pharma and the CDC vaccination program. Regardless, injecting mercury and aluminum into your bloodstream in the misguided hope of preventing flu could cause the fetal injury that leads to microcephaly. \n\nThe major media are all compromised by big drug companies, so you should always research any drug claims made on ABC, NBC, CBS, NYT, Fox, etc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-04T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-04T16:06:56.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
