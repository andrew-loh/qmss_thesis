I don’t approve of its use by Mr. Trump or his politics,” Kittos told BuzzFeed News via email. \nKittos told the BBC he was once a refugee himself, leaving Turkish-occupied Cyprus as a 6-year-old. \nIt’s unclear how the Skittles tweet, which trended on Twitter Monday evening and drew a sharp response from Skittles’ corporate owner Mars , came about. Former congressman and radio host Joe Walsh sent a similar tweet in mid-August. \nAn email to the Trump campaign about the use of the photo was not returned. Andrew Kaczynski   New York.
