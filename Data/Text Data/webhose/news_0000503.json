Protests Tuesday and Wednesday turned violent. \nTrump, who has consistently espoused a pro-police view on the trial, said that \"the problem is not that there are too many police. The problem is that there are not enough police.\" \nBringing more law enforcement to communities, Trump said, would help make America safer. \nTrump continued to pursue a narrative of his campaign of late that America's inner cities are plagued by violence, and called Clinton out of touch. \n\"Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night,\" Trump said. \"She doesn't worry about it. She's sleeping. She's sleeping. No, it's the poor family living in the inner city. It's the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country. Who is there to represent these families?\" \nRelated: Trump's Racial Rhetoric on Crime Puts Him in a Political Bind \nAccording to Trump, minorities are the ones suffering when riots and violence pop up as if has in Charlotte. \"Low-income African Americans and Latinos in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs, lost property values and, really, lost lives,\" he said.
