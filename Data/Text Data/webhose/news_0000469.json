No Trump!\" the protesters shouted before the Republican presidential nominee. He posed for a few pictured as he entered behind a procession of church leaders. — Jacob Rascon (@Jacobnbc) September 3, 2016 \nHe stood in the front row, swaying to the music as a woman on stage led the church in song. \nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters outside that Trump's visit felt like a \"Madison Avenue image makeover,\" and like he's watching the \"next season of 'The Apprentice,'\" referring to Trump's former reality TV show. \nCongresswoman Brenda Lawrence added that Trump was only there because he remains down in the polls against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, and that unlike him, she has been advocating for African Americans since the 1970s. \nTrump in recent days has shifted his attention toward minority voters, meeting with black religious and business leaders in Philadelphia on Friday and with black and Latino Republicans in New York the week before.

Black unmarked police cars followed behind a Detroit police Bearcat, a formidable armored vehicle, as security. \nSecret Service was heavy inside the lobby of the church and ordered people to go through metal detectors.
