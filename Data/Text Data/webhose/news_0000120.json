America's problems are caused by deplorable white males! Hillary Clinton said so and her sycophants in the media agree!\nLet's keep in mind that the Liberal media of Western Europe since the 1960's has condemned politicians who were willing to speak out about unnecessary immigration. They have always preferred the Angela Merkel/Francois Hollande types who advocate continued open immigration and who have now turned Western Europe into a shooting gallery for groups like ISIS. The Liberal media of Europe has blood on its hands for the Jihad-related killings that occur in Europe every other day. Why should Americans trust their own Liberal media personalities who insist that Donald Trump is a threat because he thinks that flooding his country with illegal immigrants and unnecessary legal immigrants might be a bad idea?", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-22T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-22T07:46:12.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
