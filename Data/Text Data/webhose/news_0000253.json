CBS News justice reporter Paula Reid joins CBS N with more detail... \nThe high court sidestepped the right to sue argument, but upheld the lower court decision on the merits of the lawsuit. \nSeveral other states will have marijuana initiatives on the ballot come November. \nCalifornia, Maine and Nevada will ask voters whether they'd like to legalize recreational marijuana . \nThe Golden State has been a leader in cannabis culture and policy. California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana 20 years ago. Soon, it could become the fifth and largest state to approve recreational use, with an initiative on the ballot for voters this November. \nCalifornia's medical marijuana industry is already worth an estimated $2.7 billion. Experts say that number would reportedly more than double if recreational use is allowed. \nAs the country 's most populous state and the world's sixth largest economy, passing this legislation could encourage other states to follow and pressure the federal government to confront the issue, reported CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal. \n(c) 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
