What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 9579166 \n“The tweet is right,” Trump said Wednesday. “No, I’m not saying take [men and women serving] out, but something has to happen. Right now, part of the problem is no one gets prosecuted. There are no consequences.” Adolfo Flores is a reporter   Los Angeles. Contact Adolfo Flores at .
