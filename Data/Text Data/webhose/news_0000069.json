But he was on defensive & didn't get time w Benghazi, emails & immigration. & she attacked throughout \n— Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) September 27, 2016 As I thought, Trump's strongest moments were at the beginning (on trade, though I disagree w him) but Trump boiled over later. #debatenight \n— Mary Katharine Ham (@mkhammer) September 27, 2016 So now we're going to see whether a man repeatedly shouting over a woman on national television is good politics \n— Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) September 27, 2016 After the first fifteen-twenty minutes, it was like the SS Trump hit the iceberg, then backed up and hit it again just because. \n— David French (@DavidAFrench) September 27, 2016 Moderating a panel of voters.
