President Obama has talked about it, Hillary Clinton has talked about it, and nothing gets done. Finally we have a candidate [who] is talking about it.”\nState Rep. Pedro Marin said Trump's immigration plans do not resonate with the Hispanic community.\n“Not just for Latinos, for undocumented, but also for businesses and families as well,” said Marin, who represents Duluth. “We need to build bridges, not walls.”\nFor more stories visit fox5news.com \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-30T21:11:08.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
