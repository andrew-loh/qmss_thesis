Hudak. “I commend our agents for their dedication and vigilance they show each and every day protecting our homeland.”\nReyes is accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend, 33-year-old Josefine Griggs, in the hallway of a Best Western hotel in northwest Dallas while she was on the phone with 911. Griggs had purportedly called someone earlier in the night claiming Reyes had abused her and asked the person to pick her up at the hotel.\nGriggs is heard screaming “he shot me, he shot me,” while on the phone with 911, according to an affidavit obtained by the Dallas Morning News .\nThere is also a witness who saw Reyes shooting at Griggs, the affidavit said.\nGriggs knew Reyes as Jose Rios, but he went by a number of aliases, including Martin Reyes, Victor Castillo, Juan Hernandez and Jose Reyes, police said.\nA month after Grigg’s murder, Dallas police shot and killed a man who intentionally hit an officer with his car while outside of a motel where officers and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were searching for Reyes.\nIt is unclear if Reyes will be brought to Dallas to face murder charges, but the Mexican national also faces a charge of illegal re-entry after deportation, which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T18:12:02.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
