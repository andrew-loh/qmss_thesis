Deflect blame and guilt away from Russia for it's brutal destruction of Malaysian Airlines flight 17 with every conceivable half-brained and pathetic conspiracy theory under the Sun. I must admit they are a imaginative lot. I'll list the conspiracy theories that I'm currently aware of. There are probably more since as I said, these Russian trolls are an imaginative lot.\n\n1. First there was the Ukrainian SU-25 angle that couldn't work because the SU-25 is a ground attack aircraft that can't reach the altitude that the Boeing 777 was flying at.\n\nhttps://sputniknews.com/world/...\n\n2. Then there was the older version of the BUK (SA-11 ) missile that the Russians said they no longer use but the Ukrainians still use that was supposed to be responsible for the shoot down. But is was later proved to by a Russian BUK (SA-11) Missile.\n\nhttp://www.nbcnews.com/storyli...\n\n3. Then they went back to the Ukrainian SU-25 theory but this time it includes a Israeli Python air to air missile that the Russian claim \"May\" have shot down MH17.\n\nhttps://www.rt.com/news/310039...\nRT (Russia Today) is pathetic.\n\n4. And finally they come back to the Ukrainian BUK missile conspiracy theory again conveniently at the same time that Dutch report is released. This would be hilarious accept for the fact that 298 innocent people 90 whom where children were killed. They haven't tried the space alien angle yet but give them enough time and they'll probably get around to it.\nKeep trying to obfuscate the truth with a lie and see what it gets you. You only dig a deeper hole for your country than you have already done and while your at it, please explain why on the day after the atrocity was committed by Russian anti-aircraft missile crew from the Russian armyâ€™s 53rd Air Defense Missile Brigade with Russian BUK anti-aircraft missile system.TELAR 312. Russians in Moscow gathered in from of the Dutch embassy and laid flowers and toys and asked for FORGIVENESS\n\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2014/07/21/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-moscow-embassy/", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-29T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-29T17:03:41.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
