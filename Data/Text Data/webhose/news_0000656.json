He rejected that tonight and so I must reject him,\" Houston lawyer Jacob Monty wrote Wednesday night on his Facebook page.\nThe GOP candidate appeared before supporters Wednesday night in Phoenix to deliver a much-anticipated speech about immigration that followed weeks of hints he might be softening his hard-line stand on the issue.\nInstead, Trump \"demonized immigrants,\" according to Monty, who suggested the real estate mogul \"must want to lose.\"\nTexas businessman Massey Villarreal, also part of Trump's Hispanic Advisory Council, had a similar reaction to the speech in Phoenix.\n\"Awful! As a compassionate conservative, I am disappointed with the immigration speech,\" Villarreal told NBC Latino Wednesday night. \"I'm going to flip, but not flop. I am no longer supporting Trump for president, but cannot with any conscience support Hillary (Clinton).\"\nTwo other Texans serving on the Hispanic Advisory Council, investment executive Rick Figueroa and pastor Ramiro Peña, were likewise dismayed by Trump's performance Wednesday night.\n\"Instead of listening to wise counsel from his advisors and supporters in the Latino community, who actually have first hand experience in the area of immigration, he (Trump) went in the opposite direction and doubled down on his policies and his rhetoric. This was a mistake,\" Figueroa said in a statement.\nPeña, expressed his disappointment in an e-mail to officials at the Republican National Committee.\n\"I am so sorry but I believe Mr. Trump lost the election tonight. The 'National Hispanic Advisory Council' seems to be simply for optics and I do not have the time or energy for a scam,\" the pastor wrote in a message obtained by Politico.\n\"I will pray over the next couple of days but it is difficult to (imagine) how I can continue to associate with the Trump campaign,\" Peña told the RNC officials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T01:08:49.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
