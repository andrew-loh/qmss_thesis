The dangerous treks, the abuse by gangs and cartels and the extreme physical dangers, and it must be solved, it must be solved quickly,\" the Republican candidate said.\nThe statements from Peña Nieto and Trump were followed by a brief question-and-answer session with reporters.\nIn response to a query about the border wall, which Trump has said will be paid for by Mexico, the billionaire said: \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall. That'll be for a later date. This was a very preliminary meeting.\"\nPeña Nieto invited both Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to Mexico.\nThe Mexican president said during the press conference that he extended the invitations in the interest of promoting bilateral cooperation, expressing \"absolute respect for the election process in the United States.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T03:34:06.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
