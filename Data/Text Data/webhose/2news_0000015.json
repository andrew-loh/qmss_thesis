Throughout the 90 minutes, Trump limited the interruptions that played poorly in the first debate, but Clinton's dig at him while talking about the Social Security payroll tax apparently pushed him over the edge. \nRelated: Trump Won't Say He'll Accept Election Results: 'I Will Keep You In Suspense' \nClinton said her payroll taxes would go up, and so would Trump's, unless he found a way to avoid it. Trump has not released his tax returns but has admitted, following reporting by the \"New York Times,\" that he didn't pay taxes for decades after reportedly taking a near-$1 billion loss in 1995. \nThe GOP nominee then leaned into his microphone and interrupted, \"such a nasty woman.\" \nIt was a moment that stunned even observers inured to Trump's often brutal rhetoric. Twitter immediately alighted upon his words, with Clinton supporters proclaiming themselves #nastywomen . A Clinton supporter unaffiliated with the campaign purchased the URL nastywomengetshitdone.com and had it redirect to the Clinton official site. \nRelated: Debate Was Short On Immigration, But #BadHombres Was Trending \n\"Nasty woman\" was spontaneous Trump, a seeming gift to Clinton on the spot. So was Trump's tart \"your husband disagrees with you,\" when Clinton praised the Affordable Care Act. But even if he hadn't stepped in, Clinton was ready to further drive a wedge between him and the white women who normally vote GOP.
