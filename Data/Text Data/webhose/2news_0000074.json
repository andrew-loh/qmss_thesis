Without giving a timetable for the consultation, Rudd said she wanted to \"flush out\" businesses that looked abroad rather than employing or training British workers.

O'Brien read out what he said was a line from Rudd's conference speech before revealing it was in fact a passage by Hitler. \nRudd defended her plans Wednesday. \"We should be able to have a conversation about immigration,\" she told the BBC. \"If we do talk about immigration, don't call me a racist.\" Alexander Smith ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-06T02:12:30.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
