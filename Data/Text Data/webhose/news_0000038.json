Police found him at a Red Roof Inn on Wednesday.\nHe was expected to show up at Montgomery County court on Friday. At least two other MS-13 gang members were involved in the stabbing, the Post said.\nAuthorities say that the suspect “directed” the attack on Villigran-Morales, who evidently was lured into a park by a girl, Vanesa Alvarado, who suggested they might have sex.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, said that Delgado-Perez was deported to El Salvador on October 24, 2014 and on February 26, 2015. He could be deported again, though he would likely serve his sentence first.\nMontgomery County Police Department Chief Tom Manger said that while his agency supports cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, his officers also must not be seen by the local immigrant community as quasi-immigration officials.\nManger told the Post that having the trust of the immigrant community is crucial to their willingness to approach police if they are victims or witnesses.\n“We have to strike that right balance,” said Manger. “We’ve got to be able to go into those communities and have trust and cooperation.”\nHe acknowledged the frustration among many residents over the ability of dangerous immigrants such as Delgado-Perez to return to the United States after having been deported.\n“Certainly any community is better off without these individuals,” he said.\nAs for what happened on the day that Villagran-Morales was killed, authorities say that the MS-13 gang members approached the victim and the girl who lured him there and invited him into the woods to smoke pot.\nAnother suspected gang member told police that they thought that Villagran-Morales belonged to a rival gang, but authorities believe that was just an excuse to gain gang credibility.\nPolice told the Post that they are still looking for another suspect, Jose Coreas Ventura, who is 20 and considered armed and dangerous.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-09T23:34:31.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
