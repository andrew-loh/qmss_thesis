What keep us up at night. What are our aspirations and what our thoughts about the future and those that we love.\" \nStudies have shown that once registered, Latinos have high voting rates. About 85 percent of millennial Latino voters said they definitely would vote, compared to 90 percent of Latino voters 36 and older. \nLatinos are younger than the national population as a whole and about 44 percent of Latino eligible voters are millennials. The turnout rates for young Latinos overall, those registered and not registered, lag behind the turnout rates for black and white young voters. \nRelated: For 2016, Almost Half the Latino Electorate Will Be Millennials \nElection preferences of the two groups were about the same, with 66 percent of millennial Latinos saying they'd vote for Clinton and 19 percent for Trump. \nSeventy-three percent of Latinos 36 and older said they would vote for Clinton and 16 were voting for Trump. \nHowever, 9 percent of millennials said they'd vote for a third party candidate, compared to 2 percent of 36 and older Latinos.

Third on the list was keeping the Social Security program strong. \nRelated: Think Millennials When You Think of Latinos? Think Younger \n\"When people say that the economy is a priority issue, they do have very particular things that they're talking about,\" said Sylvia Manzano, a principal with Latino Decisions. \nManzano said despite portrayals of millennials as pessimistic, the poll showed that generally, that description doesn't apply to Latino millennials. \n\"There's not a lot of pessimism among any age group — but the degree to which the younger cohort thinks things will be better is quite dramatic,\" she said. \nFollow NBC News Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
