It said it was supplied by the Sinaloa cartel and facilitated the smuggling of drugs into the United States. \nSales said Monday that Avendano Ojeda had crashed his truck and injured a federal police officer while trying to escape capture. He was allegedly carrying about 2.2 pounds of cocaine and two guns. \n(c) 2016 The Associated Press . All Rights Reserved.
