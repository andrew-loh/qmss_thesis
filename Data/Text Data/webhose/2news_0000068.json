She predicted that Trump would have called George Washington a \"loser\" for giving up the presidency after eight years and praised it as \"one of the most important decisions any president has ever made.\" \nFor the fourth straight day, Clinton kept a focus on down ballot races. She touted Democrat Patrick Murphy in his race against Marco Rubio, knocking the Florida senator for continuing to support the Republican nominee. \n\"Unlike his opponent, Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump,\" Clinton said. \"I think Florida deserves a senator who is going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform\" and \"who actually believes climate change is real.\" \nWith only two weeks left until the election, Clinton urged voters not to become \"complacent\" and to continue casting their ballots ahead of time. Conveniently, there was an early voting site up right across the street from the event. \nMid-way through her remarks, the crowd erupted into a chorus of \"Happy Birthday.\" A surprised Clinton thanked them and pivoted, calling her third and final debate against Trump an \"early\" present. She turns 69 years old on Wednesday. Monica Alba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-26T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-25T23:35:04.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
