I had some hostile questions. That was okay. It was the debate of debates,\" Trump said on the television program \"Fox & Friends.\"\nAsked if he will change anything in his next debate with Clinton, to be held Oct. 9 in St. Louis, Missouri, Trump answered that \"I may hit her harder in certain ways.\"\n\"(Yesterday) I really eased up because I didn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.\"\nTrump said that when Clinton pounced on the magnate's tendency to insult women, he felt like bringing up \"the transgressions of Bill,\" a reference to former U.S. President Bill Clinton's extra-marital adventures.\nBut he didn't do it, he said, because \"I didn't wanna say what I was going to say with Chelsea in the room.\"\nThe magnate said he was proud of having spoken swift and strong in the debate about illegal immigration, the police, law and order, business and jobs, because those are the things he thinks must be dealt with for the good of the country.\nHe also protested on Twitter that moderator Lester Holt asked Clinton \"nothing on emails. Nothing on the corrupt Clinton Foundation. And nothing on #Benghazi\" where four Americans were killed in that Libyan city in 2012 while she was secretary of state.\nThe Republican candidate also complained that he had problems with the microphone, which he blamed for the noise when he spoke that made him sound like he was sniffling with a cold.\n\"I had a problem with my mic that didn't work, I wonder if it was set up on purpose. In the room they couldn't hear me, not exactly great...I wonder if it was set up that way,\" he said.\nThe two candidates faced off against each other at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, exchanging attacks for 1 1/2 hours on matters of the economy, racism, trade policies and foreign affairs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-27T21:30:36.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
