Birth of Hispanic women ages 15 to 44 peaked at 98.3 per 1,000 women in 2006. But birth rates have fallen since the onset of the 2007 Great Recession and were at 72.1 births per 1,000 for the same age group in 2014. advertisement \nWhile Hispanics are settling in non-traditional places, that too has slowed since 2007, Pew said. \nThe share of U.S. counties with at least 1,000 Hispanics rose to 46 percent in 2007 from 38 percent in 2000, an 8-point rise. But in 2014, the increase share of such counties was 50 percent, a 4-point change from 2007.
