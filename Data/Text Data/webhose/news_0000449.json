Miguel Barbosa of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). \nBesides the criticism from politicians, many other Mexicans expressed their angered at Peña Nieto. \n“I really don’t understand how our president could invite this man,” newspaper salesman Ángel Díaz, 53, told Fox News Latino. “The president should be answering the insults and the lack respect that man has shown us, but instead he’s being friendly. Trump wants to build a wall, almost like the Berlin wall. Nothing good can come of this visit.” \nPeña Nieto also has been ridiculed for not confronting him more directly about comments calling migrants from Mexico criminals, drug-runners and \"rapists,\" and Trump's vows to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it. \nThe wall proposal has been criticized widely and fiercely in Mexico. \nMany observers – both in and out of Mexico – said that Peña Nieto’s invitation for Trump to visit was a ploy by a politician with abysmal approval ratings at home. A national newspaper poll this month put Peña Nieto's approval rating at 23 percent, its lowest level since he took office in 2012 –– only slightly better than Trump’s 4 percent favorability rating among Mexicans. \n“By meeting with Mr. Trump just hours before he unveils his latest immigration positions, Peña Nieto is allowing himself to become a pawn in this campaign,” said Jason Marczak, Director, Latin America Economic Growth Initiative. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-23T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-23T07:46:35.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
