Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam ... be allowed to reside or spread within our country. Just can't do it,\" the mogul said, adding that it is time to use \"common sense\" and properly screen immigrants.\nTrump said that Clinton had \"caused the problem,\" in part blaming her stance on immigration and her efforts as secretary of state from 2009-2013 for enabling terrorism to increase.\n\"She very much caused the problem, when you think about it. Her weakness, her ineffectiveness, caused the problem. And now she wants to be president? I don't think so,\" he said. \"Hillary Clinton is a weak and ineffective person. And I will tell you, if you choose Donald Trump (in the November elections), these problems are going to go away.\"\nHe also said that, whereas she refuses to use the term \"radical Islam\" when talking about terrorism, she has called some of his supporters \"deplorables.\"\n\"Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country,\" Trump said.\nAhmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old nationalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, was arrested Monday by police after a shootout in the city of Linden, New Jersey. He is the only suspect so far in the New York City and New Jersey bombings that wounded 29 people, and he reportedly wounded four police officers before being taken into custody.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-20T03:21:18.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
