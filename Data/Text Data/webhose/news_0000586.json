Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars,\" Trump said, referring to localities that have policies or laws that limit the extent to which they will comply with federal immigration orders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T11:15:09.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
