The talks came amid heightened urgency about the city of Aleppo, the latest flashpoint in a war that has killed up to a half-million people, sparked a refugee crisis and offered a territorial base to the radical Islamic State group. \nRelated: U.S. Attempts a New Approach to Syria Peace Talks in Switzerland \nKerry's new approach comes after last month's U.S.-Russian bid to end the war collapsed in days as Syrian forces backed by Russian airpower launched an offensive on rebel-held parts of Aleppo. \nMinisters put a brave face on the Lausanne meeting, which Kerry said was \"exactly what we wanted\" — a statement that testified mostly to low expectations. The main result was pledges to resume contact on Monday. \n\"Nobody wants to do this in a sloppy way,\" said Kerry, who only recently accused Moscow of war crimes.

For that to happen, Washington says the aerial onslaught in eastern Aleppo must stop. \nNeither side has budged in the chicken-and-egg dispute over months of negotiation. \nSaturday's talks included top envoys from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Qatar, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan. \nKerry said the discussion was driven by the \"urgency of Aleppo, the urgency of trying to find something that works other than military action.\" \nMinisters offered suggestions that \"really might be able to shape some different approaches,\" he said, without elaborating. No official news conference or joint statement followed Saturday's meeting. \nRelated: United States Suspends Contact With Russia Over Syria Impasse \nThe Syrian-Russian offensive in Aleppo prompted the U.S. to end discussions this month over a proposed military alliance against Islamic State and al-Qaida-linked militants. Last week, Kerry accused both parties of war crimes for targeting hospitals and civilian infrastructure in the Arab country. \nNevertheless, Kerry reunited with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the lakeside Beau-Rivage Palace in Lausanne, speaking with the Russian for almost 40 minutes before the larger gathering. For all the talk in Washington about a possible Plan B, U.S. hopes for diplomatic progress appeared to rest squarely on Russia's cooperation. \n\"There are a few ideas we discussed today in this circle of countries that can influence the situation,\" Lavrov told Russian news agencies. \"We agreed to continue contacts in the next few days aiming at agreements that could advance the settlement. We spoke clearly in favor of a quick launch of a political process.\" Play ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-17T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-16T21:38:51.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
