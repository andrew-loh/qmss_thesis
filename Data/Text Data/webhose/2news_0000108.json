What is the goal, purpose benefit of keeping the government agencies from functioning? How is this “conspiracy” so hard to detect, what is stopping the public outrage? Apparently the same GOP congresses from past years have done everything possible to reward private and public corporations, with everything from corporate liability, to global tax evasion and the rest. So we supposed to privatize everything, and reduce the government to a profit making business? Get don’t you. \\n\nThe media reporting or its advertisers have absolutely no interest in exposing this congressional gravy train, exposing how Congress gets elected, exposing how the flow of campaign money flows through the media owned by advertisers and the many failing of the simplest most basic function of registering voters. Where do we register guns, might I ask a serious question? \\n\nNow with every power granted to congress in the Senate and the House with 18,000 in their support staff, and 11,000 lobbyists can only be used to benefit these repeat elected offenders, and not one item to address voting, or immigration. \\n\nOr is the system rigged, not by some a hole in the street but on broad and well attended avenues of Washington D.C. \\n\nThe problem is Trump is hurling these threats against the very system he’s trying to get elected to, it be like the figures a top the wedding cake of congressional corruption. Proving that in his mind there no difference in wrong and realty wrong. \\n\nWhile we wish for the end of Trump, we won’t vote out congress and will have achieve nothing and have to wait for rot to set in to remove congress 2018, 2020, 2022 or never. \\n\n The system is guilty by reason of Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-18T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-18T19:22:12.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
