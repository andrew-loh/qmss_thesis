The government has pledged to retake Mosul this year, but has not announced a date for the operation.\nSpeaking Thursday to reporters, Geddo said UNHCR faces constraints in obtaining land for camps, erecting them in time and landing funding, but is better prepared than before a similar government operation in Fallujah this year.\nHe said UNHCR and partners are planning for at least 700,000 people who might flee Mosul.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-29T17:43:41.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
