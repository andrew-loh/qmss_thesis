Officials said they could not recognize Muna's birth because the girl was born on a vessel not registered in Malta and also had been moved onto the Russian ship before arriving.\nThe appeals court ruled on Friday that the birth can be registered for humanitarian reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-30T16:58:39.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
