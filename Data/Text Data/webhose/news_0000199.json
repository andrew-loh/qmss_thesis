Stop sneaking into our country. Yes a lot of people are just looking for jobs I understand. But a certain percentage of them are criminals and they are coming into this country and killing Americans. I wouldn't take ten thousand Mexicans into this country if it cost one American Life building a wall would be beneficial to both sides. The wall outside San Diego they say reduced illegal immigration by 90%. If a wall would stop illegal immigrants from coming into our country it would also help reduce the amount of illegal narcotics coming into our country. It would also make it harder for the drug cartels to get their drug money and weapons back across the border fueling their drug war. Then we can make sure we round up every illegal immigrant that has a criminal record and gang affiliations and we Deport them. Then the people that are here that are law-abiding hard working people. You allow them to stay and work and live here but they never get to become citizens because they broke the law. Then you can look at immigration reform. I believe our country already allow 1.1 million people to immigrated here legally every year. That is more than every other country in the world combined allowed into theirs. Coming to America is not a supply and demand situation just because millions of people want to come here does not mean it's our job to supply that for them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T01:18:34.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
