Your parents conceived you here and contributed to the success we have. Our country built itself up with democracy and freedom and we fought for it. No one can come into this country because they want to. Anyone who wants to immigrate here must earn that privilege by following whatever immigration laws exist at the time. If you don't like where you are, it's your job to improve your lot by working to improve the country where you live now - it's not our responsibility to let you in just because you have a lower standard of living,or you are oppressed or whatever. This is a completely different issue from radical Islam terrorism and with or without terrorism, our immigration laws must be followed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-14T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-14T01:02:07.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
