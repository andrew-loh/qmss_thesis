Rahami, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Afghanistan, is also thought to be responsible for bombs discovered in New Jersey. \nThe incident puts real pressure on Obama to make the case for taking in thousands of additional refugees, in the face of calls from Donald Trump and other Republican critics who say it's time to tighten the rules, not ease them. Obama's critics say the timing couldn't be worse. \n\"The timing of the summit just reinforces the idea that we need to get a handle on our refugee program,\" Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, told the Washington Examiner. \"There is a clear and present danger posed to our national security by these poorly vetted refugees that are pouring in, and the president continues to double down on his intentions to bring in more and more of the individuals from hot spots like Syria.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-20T12:22:01.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
