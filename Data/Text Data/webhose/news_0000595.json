Bush, present Trump as someone who would, as president, make life worse for Latinos and immigrants.\nBoth ads are in Spanish. The one featuring Gutierrez is airing in Florida, the second one is airing in Florida and Nevada, two battleground states with a large Hispanic population.\nIn one ad, titled “Pais Primero” (Country First), Gutierrez says he has been a lifelong Republican, but that he cannot bring himself to support his party’s nominee. He says: “Vote for Trump? I can’t. It’s dangerous, and we can’t go back. Hillary Clinton has the experience, and I trust her…I’ve been a Republican all my life, but first I am an American.”\n\nGutierrez, who was born in Cuba, is one of a few former Bush administration officials who have refused to endorse Trump and have pledged their support to Clinton.\nIn the other ad, named “Verdadera Fuerza,” or Real Strength, a narrator says: \"Because he yells and insults, Donald Trump thinks he's got strength.”\nOne scene shows Trump saying “They’re bringing crime, they’re rapists,” about people who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nThe ad then describes Clinton’s efforts to improve healthcare, programs for children and describes her as exhibiting real strength.\nIt urges people to register to vote.\nClinton holds a wide lead among Hispanic voters over Trump – but some are concerned the gap isn’t wide enough.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-07T19:38:06.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
