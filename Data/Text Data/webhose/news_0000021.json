Donald Trump’s trip to Detroit yesterday was, by any measure, a success. He got the local press he wanted, earning the A1 headline “PRAYERS AND PROTESTS” in the Detroit Free Press, accompanied by photos of the GOP candidate kissing a baby, and clapping along to prayers in church. A1 image : http://bit.ly/2cqkWiq National press gave him credit for the effort. Yamiche Alcindor and Alex Burns, on A1 of the New York Quote: : “Donald J. Trump, who has campaigned for president as a blunt provocateur, dismissing complaints of racial insensitivity as political correctness, took an uncharacteristic step on Saturday: He visited a black church for the first time and tried to blend in. Flanked by a few black supporters, including Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate, and Omarosa Manigault, a former contestant on ‘The Apprentice,’ Mr. Trump cut a subdued figure here at Great Faith Ministries International. He beamed as congregants greeted him and swayed to the chords of the song ‘What a Mighty God We Serve.’ Speaking softly, he invoked the civil rights movement and Abraham Lincoln. Donning a prayer shawl given to him by the church’s pastor, Bishop Wayne T. Jackson, Mr. Trump proclaimed, ‘I feel better already.’” http://nyti.ms/2cqn75E The front-page headline: “Trump Visits Black Church for First Time.”\nStory Continued Below\n--The Washington Post’s lead : “Donald Trump made a brief visit Saturday morning to a black church in the heart of this majority-black city, the latest step in his faltering and often awkward effort to soften the edges of a candidacy hardened by racially tinged appeals that have resonated primarily with white Republicans.” http://wapo.st/2czlXGj\n--Shane Goldmacher in Detroit : “‘I just wrote this the other day, knowing I’d be here,” Trump began, ‘and I mean it from the heart and I'd like to just read it and I think you'll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways.’... The Detroit trip seemed stage-managed to minimize any potential missteps, with a leaked script earlier in the week of the questions-and-answers Trump was supposed to deliver in a television interview conducted before the service with Jackson. Despite that, Trump claimed at the church, ‘I didn’t really know what I was getting into. I didn’t know. Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild?’” http://politi.co/2bWg4xl\nIt is September , there are 65 days until Election Day, and most Republicans we talk to believe that this isn’t about getting votes in the black community. As The Post notes: “In an average of Washington Post-ABC News polls for July and August, Trump had the support of 3 percent of black voters, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was at 91 percent.” That’s a gap he’s simply not going to make up in nine weeks. Top Republicans acknowledge this is about showing white-middle class voters that Trump is not the racist that some have branded him as. Those voters -- in places like suburban Philadelphia -- have flocked to Hillary Clinton. Trump needs to do something to at least try to get them back.\n--“Trump plans to stick to urban visits, unveil jobs plan,” by Detroit News’ Chad Livengood and Leonard N. Fleming: “Republican Donald Trump plans to return to the urban campaign trail this fall to unveil a new plan to attract employers to cities like Detroit with high unemployment rates and travel to water-crisis-stricken Flint. Trump said Saturday that his appeal for support from African-Americans in Detroit is tied to the cornerstone of his outsider bid for the White House — a complete overhaul of international trade agreements he blames for gutting inner cities. … The New York billionaire businessman said he will detail plans in the next three to four weeks to create ‘enterprise zones’ to give business tax incentives to relocate to cities like Detroit that he says ‘are suffering greatly.’” http://detne.ws/2bLACbe\nOBAMA ON TRUMP -- On an interview airing this morning, Fareed Zakaria asked President Obama about the appeal of Donald Trump: “[I]f you look at the current polls ... he’s been able to appeal to a certain group of folks who feel left out or are worried about the rapidity of demographic change, social change, who, in some cases, have very legitimate concerns around the economy and feeling left behind. ... But that’s not the majority of America. And if you talk to younger people, the next generation of Americans, they ... completely reject the kinds of positions that he’s taking. So we have to take it seriously.\n“I think that any time we hear intolerance, any time that we hear policy measures that are contrary to our values, banning certain classes of people because of who they are or what they look like, what faith they practice, then we have to be pretty hard about saying no to that. And I think that America will do that this time, as well. So overall, I’m optimistic. But, you know, I think we have to pay close attention to what’s going on.”\nA message from PhRMA: More Americans are insured than ever before, but many face insurance barriers that may interfere with a doctor’s prescribed course of treatment. Improving access to information about medication restrictions and the clinical information used to establish them can help patients make more informed decisions about coverage.

She is also up four points in North Carolina, 46 percent to 42 percent. Clinton holds a two-point lead across “all states that may be in play or could come into play this fall depending on the race, 13 in total,” according to CBS News. Anthony Salvanto, CBS News Elections Director, will unveil these results live on Face the Nation at 10:30 a.m.\n-- “Pence won’t be pinned down on immigration,” by Louis Nelson: “Chuck Todd worked hard to nail down Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence on his running mate’s immigration plan, asking the Indiana governor more than 10 times during Sunday’s installment of NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ what would happen to undocumented immigrants who had not committed a crime in a Donald Trump administration. But each time Todd asked a variation of the question, Pence demurred, pivoting as Trump often does to a pledge to remove undocumented immigrants with a criminal history first, build a wall and implement the rest of the Manhattan billionaire’s immigration proposals. Only then, Pence said, would Trump begin ‘working with the Congress to determine the best approach to that.’ The Indiana governor also defended the remarks on illegal immigration that Trump delivered last Wednesday, a fiery speech that even some Trump supporters said made them uncomfortable.” http://politi.co/2bLHJR3\nFOR THOSE KEEPING SCORE AT HOME -- Chuck Todd is the only Sunday show host to have interviewed all of the presidential and VP nominees.\nCLICKER -- Kellyanne Conway went on C-SPAN’s “Washington Journal,” and got a call from a Virginia Beach woman whose mother met Trump at his Taj Mahal hotel -- and won money in his slots! http://cs.pn/2bVChNp\nST. TERESA -- “Pope declares Mother Teresa a saint and model of mercy,” by AP’s Nicole Winfield in Vatican City: “Pope Francis declared Mother Teresa a saint on Sunday, praising the tiny nun for having taken in society’s most unwanted and for having shamed world leaders for the ‘crimes of poverty they themselves created.’ Francis held up Mother Teresa as the model for a Catholic Church that goes to the peripheries to find poor, wounded souls during a canonization Mass that drew an estimated 120,000 people — rich and poor, powerful and homeless — to a sun-filled St. Peter’s Square … The canonization was the highlight of Francis' Holy Year of Mercy and may come to define his papacy, which has been dedicated to ministering to society’s most marginal, from prisoners to prostitutes, the refugees and the homeless.” http://apne.ws/2c41G8t\nWEATHER WATCH -- From the Capital Weather Gang: “Partly cloudy, nice breeze, near 80, and Labor Day weekend? Yes, yes, yes, and yes! ... As long as you didn’t have beach plans this Labor Day weekend, it’s turning out to be pretty fantastic! Temperatures topping out near 80, a nice breeze, and spectacular sunsets are a far cry from the lashing wind and surf along the coast, although we can’t rule out a few showers mainly east of D.C. and I-95. Next up? … [A] warming trend toward midweek, with a few more 90s to add to the count before we can start truly thinking about a change in season.” http://wapo.st/2ckgfn6\nPlaybook Reads PHOTO DU JOUR: Donald Trump wears a prayer shawl during a church service at Great Faith Ministries on Sept. 3 in Detroit. | AP Photo\nRACE TO ELECTION DAY -- “Trump cuts into Clinton’s lead as crucial stretch begins: Both teams prepare for the biggest moment of 2016 – the Sept. 26 debate,” by Gabe Debenedetti: “The final stretch of the longest presidential campaign in history opens this week. Think it’s been ugly? You’ve seen nothing yet. Both Hillary Clinton’s and Donald Trump’s teams see September as the month that will make — or break — their candidate’s case for the White House. A confident Clinton fighting to keep expectations in check will ratchet up her get-out-the-vote operation while courting more Republicans to her camp. A defiant Trump will double down on the America-first message that he thinks got him this far in the first place. The Democrat's allies will continue to blanket the battleground airwaves with stinging attacks on Trump’s character. And three weeks into the month, early voting periods will open, state by state.\n“But nothing is more crucial for either contender than Sept. 26, when Clinton and Trump will meet at Hofstra University for the first presidential debate. Both campaigns have come to the conclusion that for the Republican nominee to compete in the home-stretch, he needs a shock to the system and the Hempstead, New York forum offers his best opportunity …\n“At the center of senior Clinton aides’ pre-debate concern is the belief that Trump’s last few days demonstrate how low the bar is for his performance to be called a success. If simply standing next to the Mexican president is perceived as a win for Trump's image, they complain, appearing across from Clinton will likely further elevate his standing. Indeed, Clinton's inner circle is eager to tamp down any sign of confidence, no matter her current lead or the Electoral College map.” http://politi.co/2ckapCf\nTHE MAP -- The LA Times’ Mark Z. Barabak in Atlanta: “Can Clinton turn Georgia from red to blue? It’s a matter of black and white”: “Until this summer, a black voter in Atlanta didn't matter much in the race for president. Georgia was as Republican red as its famous clay soil, having backed the GOP nominee in seven of the last eight presidential contests, including the last five in a row. But as the presidential race reaches the Labor Day weekend — once the beginning of the general election campaign but now the beginning of the end — Democrats are considering a serious run at Georgia’s 16 electoral votes.\n“That’s a measure of Trump’s weakness and of long-term shifts in the politics of states along the southeastern coast from Virginia to Florida that have grown more hospitable to Democrats. For Hillary Clinton’s campaign, an effort here carries little risk and long-term benefits that could be substantial.” http://lat.ms/2bP9Qlp … LA Times front page : http://bit.ly/2cqkNeJ\n-- A1 of the Philadelphia Inquirer: “In the suburbs, a shift, and a path to victory,” by Maddie Hanna and Michelle Bond: “Betina Lew is backing Hillary Clinton for president for ‘thousands of reasons’ - including the Democratic nominee's chief rival. ‘I am a scientist. I am an immigrant,’ said Lew, 49, a native of Brazil who three years ago moved to Yardley, Bucks County. ‘I am anything that is not Donald Trump.’ Lew reflects a wave of voters that has changed the demographics of the vote-rich Philadelphia suburbs - and who may present an especially strong bulwark to Trump's candidacy this November.Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties have grown faster than the rest of the state. They have added college graduates to become more highly educated than the commonwealth at large. They also are more racially diverse. And the swath of towns that rings the city has steadily shifted left, with Democrats now holding a registration advantage in three of the four counties.” http://bit.ly/2c3yq2z … A1 image : http://bit.ly/2bPaXBR\nDEEP DIVE -- “In Pa., boomers see the American Dream slipping away,” by Boston Globe’s Matt Viser in Butler, Pa., as part of their “America on Edge” series: “For the class of 1976 [at Butler High School], the future was as bright as their golden gowns. ... Now many in that class are turning 58 years old, and Butler [an hour north of Pittsburgh] is a shell of what it was four decades ago, with the mills long-since shuttered or shrunk — casualties of the globalized steel industry — taking most of the jobs and that old sense of security with them. People here are approaching their golden years with a sense of bitterness about the new, unforgiving economy and foreboding about what they will have to show for this life. Something their parents could count on — a comfortable retirement, debt-free and maybe in a warmer place — seems out of the question to many who say they see themselves scratching out a living until they are buried in the cemetery on the hillside near. As interviews with more than a dozen in the Butler High School class of 1976 show, many of those bright-eyed 18-year-olds now feel weary, worn, baffled, furious.\n“They were raised to work hard without complaining. But such stoicism is hard when the old dream they were sure was theirs is slipping away and with it any confidence that the country and its leaders understand their plight or care enough to try to help. Many voice regret at some of their own choices, that they didn’t put away more money sooner, and sorrow that they will now have to work, as one woman put it, ‘until the day of my funeral.’ There is frustration, too, and plentiful disgust, at the state of the government and of politics more broadly — an outlook that leads some but not all toward Donald Trump, a candidate they feel is speaking for them like no one before. Or at least not speaking like the politicians they have come to resent.” http://bit.ly/2bZHxyf\nSWING-STATE FRONTS -- Orlando Sentinel, “Presidential contest: Ride just got started” http://bit.ly/2bW7Gxs … The Palm Beach Post (right hand side, two columns), “Trump’s bill for property taxes: $1.2 million locally: But records also reveal differences in property values” http://bit.ly/2czixDe … Atlanta Journal-Constitution, “Down-ballot races can’t outshine Trump vs. Clinton: Other statewide, local candidates fear they’ll be forgotten on Nov. 8” http://bit.ly/2bZJomS … Quad-City Times of Davenport, Iowa, “From around the world, they chose us” http://bit.ly/2cpwCir … Detroit Free Press, “Some union members like Trump’s trade talk” http://bit.ly/2cqkWiq … Charlotte Observer, “Trump’s suburban white women woes” http://bit.ly/2cpxovV … Cleveland Plain Dealer (banner headline, five columns), “RNC made Cleveland a convention city” http://bit.ly/2bO7vKt .\nTRADE WATCH -- “Obama quashes prospect of fast-track Brexit UK-U.S. trade deal,” by Reuters’ Roberta Rampton and William James in Hangzhou, China: “U.S. President Barack Obama offered Britain little hope of a fast-track post-Brexit trade deal on Sunday, but said he would work to ensure the economic relationship between the two does not unravel after the British vote to leave the European Union. Obama met with British Prime Minister Theresa May at the start of a G20 summit in China as Britain embarks on the long process of reinventing itself as an independent trading nation following the shock June EU referendum outcome ... He offered May reassurance that Britain’s closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her, but did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral deal. ‘It is absolutely true that I believed pre-Brexit vote, and continued to believe post-Brexit vote, that the world benefited enormously from the United Kingdom’s participation in the EU,’ he said.” http://reut.rs/2c43Gh7\n-- “ Obama Downplays Tensions After Skirmishes During China Visit ,” by Bloomberg’s Justin Sink: “President Barack Obama downplayed dust-ups involving the U.S. delegation and Chinese security officials during the opening hours of his trip to Hangzhou for the G-20 summit, but said Sunday the U.S. would not apologize for its efforts to expand media access in the country. ‘We don’t leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips,’ Obama said after a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May, when asked about the incidents. ‘It can cause some friction. It’s not the first time it’s happened.’ ... Obama said ties with China remained strong and said not to ‘overcrank’ the significance of the incidents. Foreign countries often bristle at U.S. security and press requirements, Obama said, and visitors to the U.S. can be frustrated by security protocols. ‘None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship,’ Obama said, calling his talks with Xi ‘extraordinarily productive.’ His visit to China has also featured moments designed to project a sense of collaboration between the leaders.” http://bloom.bg/2ckfytG\nTHE GUARDIAN says the Chinese snubbed Obama by forcing him to disembark Air Force One from the lower door without a staircase: “Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s former ambassador to China, said he was convinced Obama’s treatment was part of a calculated snub. ‘These things do not happen by mistake. Not with the Chinese,’ Guajardo, who hosted presidents Enrique Peña Nieto and Felipe Calderón during his time in Beijing, told the Guardian. ‘I’ve dealt with the Chinese for six years. I’ve done these visits. I took Xi Jinping to Mexico. I received two Mexican presidents in China. I know exactly how these things get worked out. It’s down to the last detail in everything. It’s not a mistake. It’s not.’” http://bit.ly/2cpJ41Q\nA message from PhRMA: Despite having health insurance, many patients face barriers from insurers that make it difficult to access the medicines they need.

Those hopes were crushed Saturday when they learned that a longtime suspect in the 1989 disappearance had led authorities to the remains of the 11-year-old, whose abduction from St. Joseph stunned Minnesotans and changed the way parents watch over their children. ‘Our hearts are broken,’ Jacob’s mother, Patty Wetterling, texted to the Star Tribune on Saturday morning. ‘We have no words.’ Jacob was snatched off his bike, half a mile from his home, by a masked man with a gun on a dark October night. Danny Heinrich, a suspect first questioned shortly after Jacob’s disappearance and now in federal custody on child pornography charges, provided investigators with the information that led to the boy’s grave, hidden on a Paynesville farm.” http://strib.mn/2bYlckR\n2016 PLAYERS -- “Web Marketer New to Presidential Races Leads Trump’s Digital Push : Texan Brad Parscale’s success could shift Republicans’ future focus to the internet from TV ads,” by WSJ’s Natalie Andrews: “One of the highest-paid consultants to Republican Donald Trump’s campaign is a 40-year-old Texan who has never been involved in a presidential race. Web marketer Brad Parscale is managing Mr. Trump’s digital operation, which has been the source of most of the candidate’s advertising as the New York businessman has eschewed expensive TV ads and relied on cable coverage to get his message out, especially during his primary race. ‘A lot of what we do in the business world carries over,’ Mr. Parscale said. ‘We’ve brought over some tactics in the consumer world which are having incredible fundraising success for small-dollar donors.’ ...\n“The invitation to bid on Trump Organization business came in 2011 through a referral. It was a small project in web-design terms—the Trump International Realty website. He won. Along with his new partner Jill Giles, he designed that and also did projects for Melania Trump and donated services to create a site for the foundation of Mr. Trump’s son Eric that benefits St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. When Mr. Trump was considering a presidential run, he reached out to Mr. Parscale to create a web page for the exploratory committee. Later, Giles-Parscale, the firm that Mr. Parscale runs as president with Ms. Giles, designed the Trump campaign website. In the heat of the primary election, Mr. Parscale bought online ads. He was named digital director on June 21, the day after Corey Lewandowski was removed as campaign manager.” http://on.wsj.com/2cpF1Tj\nBONUS GREAT WEEKEND READS, curated by Daniel Lippman, filing from Vineyard Haven, Mass.

Kevin James, a college friend of the groom, played bagpipes as the couple recessed under the ceremonial Sword Arch — four pairs of Marines holding their sabres aloft in the aisle. Captain Brown paused to smooch his bride (twice) under the final arch.\n“Kerrville — in Texas Hill Country, an hour northwest of San Antonio— is hometown of Johnny Manziel (before he became ‘Johnny Football’ at Texas A&M), and guests at the reception at the Y.O. Ranch Hotel swapped stories about his exciting, high-scoring improvisational play at nearby Antler Stadium. College football played on big-screen TVs in the reception lobby as friends arrived to Shiner Bocks and pinot grigio. When guests checked in at the hotel, they were greeted with a cookie shaped like a boot. The rehearsal dinner fare included ‘Tejas Caesar’ and poblano chicken.
