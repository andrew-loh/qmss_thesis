His assertion that there is almost no route to get legal residency doesn't match the numbers. Over the course of each decade, we legally accept 20-30 MILLION new foreign national residents. That is a pretty big pathway to citizenship. \n\nGo to the DHS website and you will find that each year over 1 million permanent immigration green cards are issued. Additionally 1 million border crossing cards (good for ten years), 400K H and L temporary work visas( good for 6 years), 400K student visas, 100K refugees, and hundreds of thousands of other types long term visas are issued. \n\nA second assertion was that we have tried but failed at the \"impossible\" task of enforcing immigration law. Enforcement is undermined at every turn. Even border apprehensions are too often followed by releases back into the community. Interior enforcement has been spotty for decades, and almost non existent today.\n\nTrump merely said he would enforce the current laws of the land, which were determined by constitutional process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-02T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-02T10:02:40.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
