Government forces seized the Castello Road earlier this year, besieging rebel-held districts where some 250,000 people reside.\nYasser al-Yousef, a spokesman for the Nour el-Din al-Zinki rebel faction, says rebels seized Handarat late Saturday.\nThe Observatory says 213 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and shelling on rebel-held areas in and around Aleppo since a cease-fire expired Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-25T15:31:33.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
