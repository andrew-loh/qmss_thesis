This is the election to shut it down and say no more,\" Kumar said during the opening session of this week's CHCI Public Policy Conference .

As part of the voter registration drive, Voto Latino is offering VoterPal, an app for smartphones that speeds the process of registering to vote by scanning information from a driver's license directly onto a voter registration form. \nRELATED: For 2016, Almost Half the Latino Electorate Will Be Millennials \nThe groups are non-partisan although both support ideas on issues such a immigration reform that align more closely with Democrats. CHCI helps foster young Latino leaders and raises money for education efforts. It was formed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which is open to members of both parties but whose current members are all Democrats. Republicans formed their own caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Conference and operate their own non-profit leadership program, Congressional Hispanic Leadership Institute.

Rene Aguilera advertisement \n\"The average Latino voter is 27 years old. We have to go where the majority of young people are, because no one is talking to them and telling them that they are part of the political process. We found that for all the hard work we did (registering people) in 2012, we weren't meeting the need. There were 800,000 Latinos that turned 18 that year alone, but we only registered 620,000. This (VoterPal) is a tool for them to participate.\" \nSeveral national Latino groups told NBC Latino last week that they have less funding for registering and turning out Latino voters as donors have decided to funnel money to state coalitions of voter registration groups. \nRELATED: NCLR Latino Voter Registration Money Fell from $7 Million to $1.5 Million \nMatt Barreto , co-founder and managing partner of the polling firm Latino Decisions said many polls are leaving Latinos out of the picture and telling an incomplete narrative of voter participation in this election year. \n\"We've taken a look at some of the polls and I think there's a principle that I think some pollsters don't get right. We have to make sure we are using bilingual interviewers and bilingual mechanisms to contact people and that we're not just hanging up and excluding people,\" said Barreto, who does polling for the Clinton campaign. advertisement \n\"You're not getting an accurate portrait of our community (without bilingual interviewers), and that's what many of the mainstream pollsters are doing,\" said Barreto. \"They're reaching Spanish speakers and hanging up. It's hard to believe that still happens in 2016.\" \nSen. Robert Menéndez (D-New Jersey) told the gathering that the road to the White House runs through the Latino community, with immigration playing a key role. Left to right: Arturo Vargas with NALEO, Maria Teresa Kumar with Voto Latino, Matt Barreto with Latino Decisions. Rene Aguilera \n\"In 2012, fewer than half of Latino eligible voters cast a ballot, and 38 percent of Latino millennials voted. We have to do better. Our future depends on it and the issues we care about depend on it. Allowing our brothers and sisters to come out of the shadows and put them on a clear path toward earned citizenship is the civil rights issue of our time and our generation,\" Menéndez said. \n\"And we know who's trying to stop us, and that's why we absolutely have to vote in these elections. It is for them (who can't vote) that we have to vote. On January 22nd of next year, I intend to come back to Washington and put comprehensive immigration reform at the top of the new president's (agenda) and the new Senate's (agenda).\" Menéndez was one of the architects of the bipartisan Senate immigration bill that failed to move forward in the Republican-led House in 2013.
