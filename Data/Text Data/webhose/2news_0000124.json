However, the discussion went awry quickly, and will probably only be remembered for Trump calling undocumented immigrants \"bad hombres.\" Kudos to Clinton for pointing out that many undocumented immigrants likely pay more in federal income taxes than Trump does. \nNone of this mattered. The only takeaway from this debate - for Latinos and all Americans - is that the nominee of a major political party does not have faith in our elections. \nThis is wholly unprecedented. \nTo anyone who may have had doubts about Clinton and her judgment at times , this should be a wake-up call. Trump stated, in effect, that he puts his own ego above the system of government created by our Founding Fathers. This marks a new low for a divisive candidate and a sad day for his party. And there will be no walking this one back. Game over, Donald. \nRaul Reyes is an NBC Latino contributor, attorney, journalist, and TV commentator. Trump Has Reached a Breaking Point in our National Discussion About Women Celeste Montoya Celeste Montoya / Celeste Montoya \nAfter the last train wreck of a debate, Wednesday's focus on policy, at least initially, was refreshing. As a policy wonk, I want to dig in, but we are beyond that moment. Instead, we are in the unfortunate position of questioning a candidate's commitment to democracy and a basic respect for human dignity. \nOn the former, we have heard a candidate who apparently cannot lose unless the system is rigged. He has fanned the flames of voter fraud myths, calling not only for the surveillance and intimidation at the polls that were a mainstay of the Jim Crow-era, but also invoking the possibility of rebellion, rejecting a fundamental element of democracy; the peaceful transfer of power. Tonight he refused to commit to the very basic principal that he would respect the will of the people should he lose in November. \nBut why would he start showing respect now? In regard to the latter, over the past several months we have heard numerous comments from Donald Trump about Latinos, Muslims, African Americans and women demonstrating his lack of respect, for which there has been no apology. \nHis final statement revisited every dog whistle racist trope he has uttered during this election. The breaking point, however, which should have come long before, came after we not only heard him personifying the rape culture norm of male entitlement to women's bodies, but the personal testimony of women who have experienced it at his hand, literally. \nThere are those who will not change their support for either candidate. But for the one in four women who have experienced sexual assault, or the many more who have experienced sexual harassment, as well as the family and friends of these survivors, the past two weeks have resurrected a lot of pain and anger that will be hard to move beyond. \nTrump's callous response has done very little to close what looks to be a historic gender gap. Very little of what he has said or done, tonight or any night, shows any evidence that \"no one respects women more than [he] does.\" \nWhile Latinos may still have legitimate questions about Hillary Clinton, tonight she continued to speak to the issues and values that so many of us hold; the importance of accessible education, equal pay and fare wages, the safety of our children and the opportunities for them to live to their potential, and the value of family. \nCeleste Montoya is an Associate Professor in the Department of Women & Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. Donald Trump is a Threat to Democracy Stephen A. Nu?o Stephen A. Nu?o \nPresident Lyndon Johnson once stood before the Statue of Liberty and declared, \"Our beautiful America was built by a nation of strangers. From a hundred different places or more, they have poured forth into an empty land, joining and blending in one mighty and irresistible tide.\" \nWhile I may dispute the emptiness of this land when Europeans migrated here, immigration is a foundational American value. In our declaration of independence from England, Jefferson outlined the reasons for taking up arms against the Crown, and among them was that the King had \"endeavored to prevent the population of these States\", meaning our Founders saw immigration as an important component of the perpetuation of our nation. \nOur beauty as a country not only rests on our faith in the democratic process but also in the struggle to move towards a nation which pursues the values stated in the founding of our government; to form a more perfect union of these states, to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. \nIt is important to re-emphasize in this final debate and go away with a clear national understanding that Donald Trump is an absolute incomprehensible disaster. It's not only about policy but about his lack of respect for the fundamental dignity of our democracy, established by our founders. \nIt is beyond our collective memory for a presidential candidate to threaten to hold our electoral process hostage but also to have a repeated history of challenging the legitimacy of those he opposes. \nNot only was Trump a primary advocate of the birther movement, but he has now challenged the legitimacy of Clinton's candidacy by saying, \"She should not be allowed to run\" for the presidency. \nA final straw for any woman watching - as if there was one required at this point - was to hear a presidential candidate at one point say, \"No one has more respect for women than I do,\" and then turn around to our first woman presidential candidate and call her a \"nasty woman\" in a formal debate. \nStephen Nu単o is an Associate Professor in the Department of Politics and International Affairs at Northern Arizona University and an NBC Latino Contributor. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .
