So does he think we're going to applaud that here?\" \n\"These are bad ideas for the world,\" Davila Franco continued. \"I thought Hitler had already died.\" Trump gets no love in Mexico https://t.co/m6SLkTB6Cl pic.twitter.com/psO9x1DcHi — MSNBC (@MSNBC) August 31, 2016 \nThe wall and the Trump campaign promise to have Mexico pay for its construction have been contentious issues south of the border. After his private meeting with Peña Nieto, Trump told reporters at a joint press conference that they hadn't discussed the payment issue. But the president's office said he made it clear Mexico would not be footing the bill. advertisement \nOn the streets of the capital meanwhile, many were surprised that Peña Nieto would have invited Trump to Mexico in the first place. Demonstrators hold placards during a protest against the visit of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, at the Angel of Independence monument in Mexico City, Mexico, Aug. 31. TOMAS BRAVO / Reuters \n\"First of all, President Enrique Peña Nieto shouldn't have [sent out] the invitation,\" said Elizabeth Melendez, who lived in Atlanta for 11 years. \"[Trump]'s categorized us as criminals, as rapists...he's not really welcome here.\" \n\"It makes me sad, the way he speaks about Mexicans,\" said Maria Lopez, who added that she supports legal immigration and that most Mexicans travel to the U.S. looking for work. \nMarco Anton, who was browsing magazines at a newsstand, said he welcomed Trump's visit because he welcomed a dialogue between his country's president and the potential future leader of the United States. \n\"Speaking, we can understand each other,\" he said. \nBut when asked about Trump's wall proposal, Anton added: \"I don't think it's necessary.\" \nBecky Bratu reported from New York City Jacob Rascon ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T08:08:35.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
