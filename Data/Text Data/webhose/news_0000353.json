Ognen Teofilovski / REUTERS \nIt said that some 50 million kids — a \"conservative estimate\" — have been uprooted from their homes, either within their country or abroad. Some 28 million of those children were forced from their homes by war and violence, UNICEF said. \nOther figures uncovered by the report are just as stark. \nNearly one in every 200 children across the world is now a refugee, double the figure of 10 years ago. And just two countries, Syria and Afghanistan, accounted for around 45 percent of all child refugees. \nAnd around 100,000 unaccompanied children filed claims for asylum across 78 countries in 2015 alone, according to UNICEF.
