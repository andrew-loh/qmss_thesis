4 of the main Libyan oil ports. Brega, Ras Lanuf, Zuetina and Sidra ports are all now under the control of the legitimate Libyan government in Tobruk and out of the hands of the US backed radical Islamic terrorists. Also under control of the Tobruk government are some oil production fields. The Libyan National army came together from the East, South and West in a joint action to retake the oil resources belonging to the Libyan people from the terrorists who had been controlling them. These terrorists had been in prison in Libya before the 2011 illegal attack by NATO. \nThe radical Islamist, Ibrahim Jadran and his 4 brothers are LIGF (Libyan Islamic Fighting Group started by Belhaj). The 5th brother is Ansar al Sharia. The brothers were controlling the oil ports as a result of US support against the Libyan people. This family of 5 brothers were all criminals in jail in Libya before the 2011 attack and were released by NATO and their mercenaries. They now will try to join with the UN puppet government and the criminal militias in Misurata encouraging them to invite in US/Italian forces to take back their control of the oil. \nConsider this: Sitting in the Libyan seat at the UN security Council is a German national named Martin Kobler. The Libyan's are furious, who can blame them, they have had their country stolen from them, they have millions in exile, at least one million homeless and infrastructure destroyed. Their country is filled with illegal radical terrorists - armed and funded by the Zionists via the US, stealing them blind, killing their women, children and young men, imprisoning thousands of innocents without due process..torturing many to death. \nMartin Kobler is a member of the intelligence community, do you really believe he knows, understands or cares about the culture or desires of the Libyan people? Of course not, he is a spy, it is his job to appoint a puppet government (so called Unity government) filled with Muslim Brotherhood, Ansar Al Sharia, LIFG, ISIS, Al Qaeda, etc., some of them not even Libyan. Force this puppet government on the Libyan people, sneak them in by the dark of night by boat and hide them at the Mitiga Airport under control of Belhaj,another terrorist. \nIn what alternate universe does the UN appoint a representative for a country from another country? This is obvious terror tactics to control a sovereign nation. \nAs the Libyan people begin to take back their country from the proxy army (terrorist mercenaries) of the Zionists, the Zionists can see their control slipping from their fingers and have already started talking about taking another action in Libya similar to NATO's war crimes committed in 2011. Today the Italian parliament was discussing another incursion into Libya. The US has already been bombing in Libya invited in by the UN puppet government representing the Zionists not the Libyans. \nIt is most urgent that the news be spread correctly as the Zionist (Khazarian mafia) controlled media has already started spreading the lies about what is happening in Libya. Kobler sat at the UN today telling the UN that Libyan people need to come together under his unity government. Kobler has no clue about Libya and no right to speak for the Libyan people but mark my works he will be lying and leading the charge to attack Libya as the Zionists control slips away from them. \nI am posting 2 reports from Libyan security regarding 2 of the brothers that had been controlling the Libyan oil ports and some of the Libyan oil. This is a copy of their criminal files. Tags: A PERSONAL MESSAGE Support Us \nWe would like to thank everyone who has supported us... their prayers and best wishes.

News reported</a> Dobbs’ “surprise announcement” that he was quitting CNN.</p><p>&#8220;This will be my last broadcast,&#8221; Dobb said, noting CNN had allowed him to be released early from his contract.</p><p><em>Like the reporting you see here? <a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/sign-up-for-wnds-free-email-alerts/\">Sign up for free news alerts from WND.com, America&#8217;s independent news network.</a></em></p><p>Summarizing Dobbs’ career with CNN, Fox News noted the host underwent a &#8220;worldview&#8221; shift after 9/11:</p><blockquote><p>Dobbs was a CNN original, signing on when the cable network started in 1980. For much of that time, he hosted a nightly business broadcast that became one of the most influential shows in the corporate world, and CNN&#8217;s most profitable show for advertising revenue.</p><p>But Dobbs said his worldview changed after the 2001 terrorist attacks and corporate corruption scandals, and he began to more freely express his opinions. He was particularly persistent in bringing the immigration issue to the fore, winning him both higher ratings and enemies. Latino groups had an active petition drive seeking his removal.</p></blockquote><p>The Fox News article quoted Roberto Lovato, co-founder of Presente.org, as saying: &#8220;Our contention all along was that Lou Dobbs – who has a long history of spreading lies and conspiracy theories about immigrants and Latinos – does not belong on the most trusted name in news. We are thrilled that Dobbs no longer has the legitimate platform from which to incite fear and hate.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\" http://www.presente.org/campaign/basta-dobbs/\">An article still on the Presente.org website without a date</a>, titled “Basta Dobbs” (translated as “Enough Dobbs”), boasts that Presenté forced CNN to cancel Dobbs by launching a campaign aimed at threatening advertisers with reprisal unless they agreed to stop funding the show.</p><p>“CNN calls itself ‘The Most Trusted Name in News,’ but for years they provided a platform for Lou Dobbs to spread dangerous myths about immigrants and use dehumanizing and disrespectful language toward the Latino community,” the article on Presente.org claims.</p><p>“In 2009, Presente.org fought back, spearheading a multi-stage, national campaign with dozens of partners demanding that CNN remove Dobbs,” the Presente.org article states. “On November 11, 2009, that campaign achieved its goal when Dobbs abruptly resigned from CNN, marking a major victory for Latinos and our allies.”</p><p>The Presente.org article continues:</p><blockquote><p>Dobbs&#8217; departure came after months of negative press and controversy, much of it spurred by the Basta Dobbs campaign. &#8220;Basta Dobbs&#8221; became a rallying cry for Latinos and our allies concerned about Dobbs&#8217; long history of anti-immigrant and anti-Latino rhetoric. We took advantage of two strategic openings at CNN: the network’s efforts to define itself as a neutral alternative to Fox News and MSNBC, and CNN’s desire to court Latino viewers through a new &#8220;Latino in America&#8221; series. Our core message was that CNN “can’t have it both ways” – seeking Latinos as viewers while giving Dobbs a platform for his near daily attacks.</p><ul><li>To deploy this message, we partnered with leading Latino organizations and other allies in cities across the country &#8212; from Los Angeles to Phoenix to Orlando. We joined together to successfully demand that CNN no longer allow Dobbs to spew hate thinly disguised as &#8220;news.&#8221; To ensure the message got across, we used a variety of tactics including:</li><li>An online video, produced with award-winning documentarian Arturo Perez, called “CNN: Lou Dobbs or Latinos in America?”</li><li>A text-message short-code publicized via radio and on-the-ground events, which enabled people to join the campaign.</li><li>Significant press, op-ed and PR push – in English and in Spanish – throughout the campaign, including the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, El Diario and La Opinion.</li><li>On-the-ground events – coordinated via text-message reminders &#8212; in 18 top Latino media markets across the country.</li><li>A digital sit-in on CNN’s Web site, which allowed Presente.org members to deliver their comments and pictures directly to CNN.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The article concludes by claiming the “Basta Dobbs campaign helped demonstrate the enormous potential of uniting online organizing with traditional on-the-ground organizing.”</p><p>The article notes that by “recognition of its achievements,” it was named &#8220;Campaign of the Year,&#8221; by the New Organizing Institute, another Soros-funded organization that the Presente.org article identified as “the leading progressive organization conducting training, research, and evaluation in new organizing strategies.”</p><p><b>Media Matters piles on</b></p><p>On Nov. 12, 2009, the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters <a href=\" http://mediamatters.org/blog/2009/11/12/updated-so-what-really-happened-... the role of Presenté in Dobbs departure from CNN</a> while also taking a bow for “playing a leading role in the Drop Dobbs Coalition (DropDobbs.com) which was launched to call attention to Dobbs’ incendiary hate speech and falsehoods.”</p><p><a href=\"/files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3666384\" src=\" http://www.wnd.com/files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE... alt=\"SOROS screen capture DROP DOBBS WEBSITE 2009\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"/files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009.jpg 599w, /files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009-300x199.jpg 300w, /files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009-340x226.jpg 340w, /files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009-95x63.jpg 95w, /files/2016/09/SOROS-screen-capture-DROP-DOBBS-WEBSITE-2009-129x86.jpg 129w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></a></p><p>Below is a screen capture from DropDobbs.com in 2009 after Dobbs announced he was leaving CNN.</p><p>Media Matters further claimed that through the coalition, “Media Matters worked successfully behind the scene to persuade major corporations to stop advertising on Lou Dobbs Tonight.”</p><p>The article listed the following organizations, many of which were Soros-funded at the time: National Council of La Raza, LULAC, National Hispanic Media Coalition, America&#8217;s Voice Education Fund, The Hispanic Institute, Southern Poverty Law Center, Netroots Nation, Voto Latino, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, Center for New Community, Reform Immigration for America, Dolores Huerta Foundation, National Puerto Rican Coalition and Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.</p><p>While <a href=\" http://mediamatters.org/blog/2009/11/12/updated-so-what-really-happened-...

I have brought this problem to the program director, to the Walden University ombudsman, and to the university president with no real plan or solution to move this forward offered by the university so far.”</p><p>Palmer has come to see the delays as a strategy implemented by the managers of Walden University to extract more money from graduate students.</p><p>“I believe that the objective for the university is to keep the students in 9000 courses as long as they can because the university collects about $8,000 for each two classes taken, while incurring no real overhead costs,” Palmer argued.</p><p>“Only recently has Walden University offered to provide $8,000 in financial relief, but only after I have escalated my frustration to the president. I believe that this is misrepresentation and outright fraud,” he wrote, in obvious frustration. “I believe that the university is not compliant to their publicized program plan, and they are abusing the students and the student federal aid system.”</p><p>He concluded: “My federal aid loan is over $165,000 so far and I am not done yet. I started the program in 2009 and am still not done and there is no end in sight that I can see. I believe that this requires an investigation into Walden University for abuse, fraud and mismanagement of the DBA program and financial aid funds.”</p><p><b>&#8216;I hope you can make our case more public&#8217;</b></p><p>Tonia De Aune Wilson, Ph.D., M.A. Ed., a sports psychology coach and personal fitness trainer, told WND she is &#8220;one of the many students who have had myriad issues with Walden University and become deep in debt for my education.&#8221;</p><p>“I enrolled in 2007 with the promise that I could finish a PhD in psychology in four years if I went full time and six if I went part time,” she said. “I was enrolled both part- and full-time throughout the coursework process, but by the time I reached the dissertation phase, suddenly I was not able to find a dissertation chair even after being given a list of interested faculty.”</p><p>Despite this expression of interest, Wilson was not able to find a suitable faculty adviser.</p><p>“All of them replied to me that they were full and could not take me on,” Wilson explained. ”When I asked my adviser, he told me that I could either take a leave of absence until someone was available, or take some extra classes in order to stay enrolled. If I were to take the leave of absence, I would not be able to pursue a dissertation chair because I would not have been considered a student.”</p><p>Finally, Wilson found a faculty member to chair her dissertation program.</p><p>“She was incredible,” Wilson acknowledged. “All of her students were making great strides in their dissertations, in short periods of time, but at some point, she was let go from the Department of Psychology for unknown reasons.”</p><p>After this, Wilson’s co-chair took over supervising her dissertation.</p><p>“He was completely inept,” she complained. “He read five-six pages at a time even though I was giving him entire chapters. He took up to three weeks to respond to emails and was never available by phone. Many students in his section dropped out because they ran out of money.”</p><p>Wilson spent three school terms with the new chairman but failed to make any progress on her dissertation.</p><p>“I filed a complaint with the department chair, the university ombudsman, and the Better Business Bureau,” she explained.</p><p>”Finally, after threatening litigation, the department chair took over my dissertation and I had to find a new co-chair. It took two years to finish a dissertation that should have only taken a year. I went in debt $35,000 over my original tuition that I had paid out of savings and trusts.”</p><p>Wilson finally graduated in 2015, only to find Walden University had no job placement program, despite advertising the existence of one.</p><p>“I am so dismayed that I have such debt and no job related to my PhD. I am a schoolteacher,” Wilson concluded. “I am single, and I have all of this debt now. At this time in my life, I should be saving for retirement with much more assertion than this, but it will take me at least 10 years to pay this down. Meanwhile, I haven&#8217;t contributed to my retirement for the entire duration of my Ph.D. in order to pay for it.”</p><p>She emphasized: “I hope that you can make our case more public so that the big Laureate Education doesn&#8217;t keep throwing money at lawyers and judges to throw out our cases.”</p><p><b>&#8216;My credit is ruined, I’m depressed&#8217;</b></p><p>Maria Wallace, a Walden University student who entered the Public Health Ph.D. program in 2007, described herself as a Walden University student &#8220;who is struggling and hopes to see some justice.&#8221;</p><p>“I started the Ph.D. in Public Health at Walden in 2007 and everything went well until I entered the dissertation process,” she explained. “My chair was very simple and performed as a novice. Not much guidance or feedback. My prospectus was approved in 2012 for a qualitative study on high school dropout and health.”</p><p>Wallace had every reason to believe her dissertation completion at Walden would be as easy and direct as completing her course work.</p><p>“I worked very hard to write each chapter,” she continued. “My chapter 3 was completed about 2 years ago. At the end of December 2015, I was told that they were not convinced that my topic can even be studied and that I should consider a quantitative study instead. Every semester, time is wasted with online discussion and no real help with the proposal at all.”</p><p>Now, Wallace believes the delays she encountered were part of a Walden University plan to extract more money from her.</p><p>“It was clear that my thesis adviser was not even reading my paper,” she stressed. “Sometimes it took six weeks for feedback. After almost 10 years, my proposal is not approved. I have spent $100,000 with nothing to show.”</p><p>In addition to financial loss, Wallace has experienced what she considers a professional setback to her career.</p><p>“I am embarrassed because at my workplace, people who started with other universities five years after me are already done,” she concluded. “I am $100,000 in debt. My credit is ruined. I am depressed and I cannot continue paying.”</p><p>Wallace’s sense of loss was apparent.</p><p>“As students, we are suffering and very afraid to speak out about that university,” she said. “Walden University is a scam and a rip-off.”</p><p><i><a href=\" http://superstore.wnd.com/Partners-in-Crime-Hardcover-Jerome-Corsi\">Now more than ever, Bill and Hill are &#8220;Partners in Crime.&#8221; Jerome Corsi reveals &#8220;The Clintons&#8217; scheme to monetize the White House for personal profit.&#8221;</a></i></p> Posted: 1 week 5 days ago At least 5 felons among Clinton Fou... \n<p><a href=\"/files/2016/07/Prison-bars.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3502874\" src=\" http://www.wnd.com/files/2016/07/Prison-bars.jpg\" alt=\"Prison bars\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"/files/2016/07/Prison-bars.jpg 600w, /files/2016/07/Prison-bars-300x150.jpg 300w, /files/2016/07/Prison-bars-340x170.jpg 340w, /files/2016/07/Prison-bars-126x63.jpg 126w, /files/2016/07/Prison-bars-172x86.jpg 172w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></a><br /> NEW YORK – A list that has been largely ignored by establishment media is the remarkable number of foreign millionaire and billionaire donors to the Clinton Foundation who have been convicted of crimes.</p><p>At least five individuals are on the list, including several the Clintons treated as international celebrities at various Clinton Global Initiative annual meetings, even after their criminal convictions.</p><p>Some have been convicted of crimes in the United States and are currently serving sentences in federal prisons.</p><p>It raises the question of whether or not Hillary Clinton, should she be elected president, would pardon the donors.

Rajaratnam was forced to pay a criminal and civil penalty of over $150 million and sentenced to 11 years in a federal prison, while Gupta was fined $5 million and sentenced to two years in federal prison.</p><p>“Before his arrest, Gupta was a top player in Democratic circles with close personal ties to the Clintons,” <a href=\" http://freebeacon.com/politics/clintons-wall-street-pal-to-serve-out-pri...

In 2009, Rajaratnam and his wife gave a total of $118,000 to Democratic Party candidates, including to Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama, as well as to Hillary Clinton.

And he did it with the support of hundreds of major corporations that advertised on his show. No one was fighting back effectively; our movement didn’t have an answer to Glenn Beck.”</p><p>Color of Change openly admits running an economic campaign to drive Beck off Fox News, claiming it was launched in July 2008 when Beck called President Obama a “racist” with a “deep-seated hatred for white people.”</p><p>Some 285,000 people signed a Color of Change petition to Beck’s advertisers demanding Beck be removed from Fox News.</p><p>Color of Change described the campaign against Beck:</p><blockquote><p>Within days of Beck’s attack on President Obama, tens of thousands of Color Of Change members were signing our petition to all of Beck’s advertisers, channeling our outrage into meaningful and strategic leverage over Fox News. At the same time, behind the scenes, our staff initiated a dialogue with some of Beck’s biggest advertisers, corporations including Walmart, CVS, Best Buy and Sprint. We conveyed to them the concerns of our members, and presented them with a clear choice: stop funding Beck, or become publicly associated with his racism and divisiveness. We partnered with Media Matters to track ads on Beck’s show, and worked with organizations including CREDO Action, MoveOn and Jewish Funds for Justice to draw more people into the campaign and increase the pressure.</p><p>Most companies moved quickly to pull their ads, once they understood the power of our members to hold them accountable. When a corporation refused, our members took action, flooding them with hundreds of phone calls, and spreading content and commentary on social media that linked their brand to Beck and his attacks on Black people. Nearly every corporation we targeted pulled their ads. The victories snowballed, continuing for months.</p></blockquote><p><i><a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/hill-and-bill-exposed-as-partners-in-crime-4-...

There was an enrollment adviser who would call me constantly.&#8221;</p><p>The Walden University adviser promised her that she would have a Ph.D. within five years.</p><p>&#8220;I was young, broke and desperate,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I figured maybe this would be a great opportunity for me to one day make lots of money as a Ph.D. and take care of my family. He called so much, I decided to enroll. It was a huge mistake.&#8221;</p><p>What she encountered was constant demands to take costly additional courses.</p><p>&#8220;I started to be blocked from classes if I didn&#8217;t get more financial aid,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;I was constantly adding to my debt and financial aid. I stopped even looking at the amount of the loans because I desperately wanted out of the program and fast. Three years into the program, I realized Walden had not even granted me a masters even though I had completed all the courses required for a masters and was eight classes into my Ph.D. program.&#8221;</p><p>Next, she found herself in a seemingly never-ending process of revising her doctoral thesis.</p><p>&#8220;I found myself constantly enrolled in thesis writing that ended up involving some eight different advisers,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I would be sent back the same document with no helpful commentary. It would be the same document after I changed it several times and no helpful remarks from the professors. None.&#8221;</p><p>After eight different advisers, she found herself stonewalled, unable to recruit another Walden University professor to be her adviser.</p><p>&#8220;I found myself emailing random people to see if they [would] be my thesis professor. Then they would not communicate at all, and I&#8217;d be left with a paper that was that the university told me was not good enough.&#8221;</p><p>She continued: &#8220;I got upset, and I started calling and emailing to get answers. I was hung up on many times, yelled at, and dismissed by ombudsman. I just wanted to know where my Masters was because, at this point, I just wanted out. I called and called.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, in 2009, she &#8220;was told that if I paid more money, I&#8217;d be done.&#8221;</p><p>Instead of a Ph.D., Walden ultimately gave her a master&#8217;s degree.</p><p>&#8220;I asked my poor mom to please give me the money just so I could get out, though without my Ph.D.,&#8221; she said, concluding her story. &#8220;But I am stronger now, smarter and know better. I know Walden stole from me. I owe over $100,000 in student debt, and I hope one day there will be vindication.&#8221;</p><p><b>10 years without a degree</b></p><p>A similar story comes from L. Essence Pryor, a high-school teacher.</p><p>&#8220;It has been a long 10 years for me at Walden University, and now I’m over $100,000 in student loans, all without a degree,&#8221; Pryor explained.</p><p>&#8220;All of my coursework has been completed, and I have had a change of three chairs and six co-chairs, not to mention lag in response and a firing of one of my professors who had been with me 3+ years before Walden University fired her,&#8221; Pryor continued. &#8220;The new chair gave me an unsatisfactory grade even though the quality of my work had not changed.&#8221;</p><p>Pryor has complained to Walden but without satisfaction.</p><p>&#8220;I have contacted Walden about this situation, but the university has still not given me a firm timeline to finish, nor offered to compensate me for at least one year while I finish my degree,&#8221; Pryor said. &#8220;What Walden asked in return was for me to sign a release agreeing not to sue them.&#8221;</p><p>Walden insisted Pryor had to sign the release before the university would resume her graduate program.</p><p>When Pryor refused, Walden declined to resume her graduate studies or to allow her to receive a degree, despite 10 years of effort and $100,000 in accumulated student debt attending the university.</p><p><b>&#8216;I panicked, took a leave of absence, and was severely depressed&#8217;</b></p><p>Helene Carrington is a student who enrolled at Walden in 2008 and participated in a class-action suit, Travis et al v. Walden University LLC, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland and dismissed in 2015.</p><p>Carrington sent WND the statement of her case that she submitted as her testimony in the class-action case.</p><p>She testified she had been enrolled at Walden University since the fall term of 2008 in the Doctorate of Education program with specialization in administration and leadership for teacher learning.</p><p>She said, however, she was currently enrolled in the Educational Specialization (Ed.S.) program, a lesser degree program in the same area of study.</p><p>&#8220;I successfully completed all coursework toward my Doctorate Degree in Education after the Fall Term of 2010 (9/7-12/26),&#8221; she said.</p><p>Carrington entered the proposal/dissertation stage from the spring term of 2011 through the summer term of 2014.</p><p>&#8220;I completed a total of 10 out of 11 successful proposal/dissertation terms according to Walden University guidelines/transcripts,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I received the only &#8216;U&#8217; for &#8216;unsatisfactory&#8217; grade during the summer term (5/6-8/25). The same chair member who gave me this &#8216;U&#8217; had passed me on successfully, although there is no difference in my performance or lack thereof. I argued the point with the chair to no avail.&#8221;</p><p>The unsatisfactory grade sent Carrington into a crisis.</p><p>&#8220;Because of this &#8216;U,&#8217; I panicked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I took a leave of absence, as I was severely depressed and unsure of what I needed to do. I then decided to complete a petition for a different chair and was granted one.&#8221;</p><p>She returned to school in January 2014 and completed two successful terms under her new chair, even though she found the guidance, communication and assistance completely different than she had received from her previous chair.</p><p>&#8220;I was angry after the first successful term under the new chair and proceeded to see what could be done to recoup anything, whether it be time, money, or a grade change through what Walden called a Tuition Waiver Petition,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;I argued my case numerous times, was denied the waiver and then I appealed it, but was also denied.&#8221;</p><p>The cost of continuing her doctorate program forced Carrington to settle for the lesser degree.</p><p>&#8220;The cost of tuition at that time was $5,108 per term,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;Clearly, I did not have the ability to borrow, as I was denied a secondary loan. The only solution I found was to switch programs and seek the Ed.S Degree, which was not my intent. However, I felt it was the only scenario available to me.&#8221;</p><p>Carrington paid Walden $4,470 for the spring term in 2011, only to find the tuition increased each term, ultimately costing $5,100 for the summer 2014 term.</p><p>&#8220;I would estimate that I paid $35,000 in extra costs, given the delays I faced, with what I calculate were seven terms of study that I really didn’t have to take to complete the original doctorate program,&#8221; she wrote.</p><p>She noted the two chair professors she was forced to work with were like &#8220;day and night&#8221; in how they treated her.</p><p><i><a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/hill-and-bill-exposed-as-partners-in-crime-4-...
