We are here for your protection License DMCA \nEgberto is right and I feel some of what Tony is saying. It is really difficult for me to sort out what is reality about how our country and the world work. As I learn, it is increasing clear to me that others are having similar difficulty \nThe greatest eye-opener I saw to become motivated to learn more about current political reality is when Occupy brought to my attention and the attention of the people of US and world that the 1% controls the other 99%. \n\"Wealthiest 1% will soon own more than rest of us combined, Oxfam says. http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/world/wealth-inequality/ , and; continuing, \n\"The richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014,\", and; \nThe 80 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion people, the report says. - Advertisement - \nThe world is the way it is because we/I have allowed the .1% to create the world. Yes we need resources, for shelter, food and dignity as Tony writes, and we need to stand by our friends even when they mistakes, while in no way do we condone and enable them to continue to do wrong. The .1% could change all of this for the better, so why haven't they done so? \nChris Hedges has said it is because they do not fear us. They control what most of us read if it is main stream to a large extent, and hence create a false reality of what is really going on; e.g., the US/NATO and West's support of terrorists against Syria, a country we are turning into rubble. \nSince they have for decades stopped being afraid of us, they no longer see us, hear us or feel. They destroyed labor unions with some help later on from the sellout union leadership like neoliberal George Meany, radical writers banished from the publishing world, and the uncompromising leftists hounded, killed and run out of the country, as the Dulles brothers created the cold war to suck up peace dividends, establish the surveillance state to carry out black ops against American and foreign political leaders, and essentially extended tentacles into the most important levers of the peoples' government, state, department of war. Meet Allen Dulles: Fascist Spymaster, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4respKAbOc , health and education global finance and undo laws we had put in place to check their alien roguishness. They are not like us, we are sheep to them, or \"eaters\" as Kissinger has said, subjected to chemical and biological weapons testing; FDA approves GMO mosquito test in Florida, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-approves-gmo-mosquito-test-to-combat-zika/ \nWould they authorize an attack on a hospital? Of course they would, can't have doctors healing rebel fighters, http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/25/politics/afghanistan-kunduz-doctors-without-borders-hospital/ . A U.S. airstrike that mistakenly killed 30 people at a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, last month was, in part, the result of military personnel inadvertently aiming at the wrong target -- the hospital compound -- instead of a suspected nearby site, from which Taliban fighters were firing, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said Wednesday. \"Americans are fleeced by trillions of dollars to support this faรยงade, and they expect us to believe that they clumsily hit the wrong target? We should demand our money back! They are laughing at us like we are fools and idiots. While they work their elitist globalization scheme, acts as drunken fools to threaten two major nuclear powers, Russia and China, and use terrorists organizations such as Al Nustra, formerly Al Qaeda of Iraq, whose leaders know that they are being used to tear up the Middle East to help the West march to the doorsteps of Russia and China, and position missile systems that would essentially guarantee MAD should the aliens launch or either. I think it is clear to those reading the alternative media, that the .1% is insane. Putin has chastised the MSM for not educating the western public about what our governments are doing on behalf of the ruling elites. He has not bothered to name names. But I think we'd better get busy finding out who the .1% is.\" \nThe ruling elites believe that they are untouchable, that they can reduce the population sufficiently to preserve resources for themselves. Sure, I may be a bit crazy too. That's why I try to read the crazy from many sources. The MSM has some crazy too but I have to be really careful reading it because they can infect you with BS. 3 stories that show the War of Terror is a fraud, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC5slIPZ5nI . On the other hand reading MSM makes me laugh out loud crazy sometimes. Digressing, it was interesting to read the pundits for the NYT who beat up on Bernie during the primaries, the Blow, Krugman, even civil-rights giants; e.g., John Lewis who claimed that Bernie never marched with Rev. King. So I no longer believe it is strange that the left/right dichotomy is mostly fictitious. We have allowed ourselves to become divided and manipulated to be blind to our common interests, to take this team or that team's slogan and programs when the puppet master's strings are still attached. I am beginning to realise that the .1% are truly alien. I believe a lot of other people are realising the same. If Americans will become more aware, we have a chance to get out of here alive. We may become connected to reality again recognizing that the .1% is the disease and that it is hell bent on destroying multicellular life on this planet. - Advertisement -", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-25T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-25T03:10:32.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
