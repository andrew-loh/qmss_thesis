You have to start the right way and everyone has to go through the same process. People who've done it and who've gone through that process legally, they shouldn't be penalized,\" he said.\n\"She's probably a great lady. Ok. I get it. But you have to do it right. We have to be able to figure out a way that benefits all. And is egalitarian to all,\" Trump Jr. added.\nSilva, now 28, entered the United States from Mexico when she was just four years old. The daughter of a landscaper and a domestic employee, she became an outstanding student who entered a technology magnet school behind the backs of her parents, who feared the paperwork would out her as an undocumented migrant.\nA recipient of a work permit under the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, she is an activist for comprehensive immigration reform who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in July in Philadelphia.\nSilva first gained prominence when Obama mentioned her in a Nov. 20, 2014, speech announcing a series of executive actions to, among other things, expand the population eligible for the DACA program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-10T18:20:58.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
