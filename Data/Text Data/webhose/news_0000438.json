Same thing for the other foreign nationals. Private prisons were and are a joke. The jury is still out as to whether they cost less than government run facilities. One thing is sure. The level of violence, due to poor training and staffing levels, is significantly higher in private prisons, who are interested first and foremost in their bottom line. That leaves the government liable for lawsuits in addition to the companies that run these facilities. Idaho recently terminated its contract with CCA because of fraud, staffing issues and lack of adequate medical care. This was only after the state had to pony up a lot of money in damages to inmates who were assaulted, or received poor medical attention.\n\nClosing these facilities only moves the problem to a different arena. The real solution is to streamline the whole process of deportation. We need an urgent overhaul of our immigration system that puts an end to endless appeals. Give the illegals a single fair hearing, with the onus of proof on them to demonstrate that either they are here legally, or proof that they qualify for refugee status. No more appeals, Right after the hearings, take them straight to the airport and send them home. If their home country refuses to take them, then we end all aid to that country and no longer allow any of their citizens to come here for any reason other than diplomatic missions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-17T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-16T19:37:58.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
