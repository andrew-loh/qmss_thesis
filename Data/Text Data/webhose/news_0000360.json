As an educator, she has deepened our understanding of American identity,” the White House said in a statement.\nJimenez will be honored for his “conjunto” music and “lending the sounds and cultures of south Texas and Mexico.”\n“His lively melodies performed on the two-button accordion have captivated audiences around the world,” the statement continued.\nThe White House said Valdez was honored for highlighting Chicago culture in his work.\n“He illuminates the human spirit in the face of social injustice through award-winning stage, film, and television productions,” the White House said in the statement.\nThe artists and other leading creative figures have been invited to receive the medal at a White House ceremony on Sept. 22. President Barack Obama and First lady Michelle Obama are planning to attend.\nAmong the National Humanities Medal recipients are jazz legend Wynton Marsalis, public radio host Terry Gross and author James McBride.\nOthers receiving the National Medal of Arts:\n— Record producer and songwriter Berry Gordy\n— Dancer and choreographer Ralph Lemon\n— Painter Jack Whitten\n— The Eugene O'Neill Theater Center\nOthers receiving the National Humanities Medal:\n— Author Rudolfo Anaya\n— Author Louis Menand\n— Author Ron Chernow\n— Prison University Project, Higher Education Program\n— Physician and author Abraham Verghese\n— Historian and author Elaine Pagels\n— Journalist and author Isabel Wilkerson\n— Poet Louise Gluck\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-15T23:36:30.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
