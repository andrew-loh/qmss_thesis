We’re gonna have secure borders. We’re gonna have e-verify system, we’re gonna end sanctuary cities. We’re gonna get people out of this country in short order who represent a threat to our families and our communities.” \n“But it’s all gonna be on that foundation that rejects amnesty and says there’s no path to citizenship, there’s no path to legalization unless people are outside the country,” Pence added. \nPence also called Trump’s forthcoming Mexico trip “nothing short of presidential leadership.” Andrew Kaczynski is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.
