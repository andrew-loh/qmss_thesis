Revolution's 47th year anniversary. Libya is fighting to return to the Great Jamahiryia (formed after the Al Fateh revolution). The Libyans work to free their country from the 2011 illegal war and occupation by the Zioinists and their radical Islamic mercenaries (proxy army). Libya will win. \nThe 1969 bloodless coup (Al Fateh Revolution) that gave Libya back to the Libyans and put Ghadafi in charge; changed the face of Libya forever. From poverty to prosperity, the first time in Libya's history the Libyan people were free of occupation and were allowed to own their own land. One of Ghadafi's first acts was to give the land to the Libyans who had worked as slaves to the Italians for many many years. Photos are from celebrations at Al Fateh University in Benghazi tonight as September 1st rolls in.

In 2009, Rajaratnam and his wife gave a total of $118,000 to Democratic Party candidates, including to Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama, as well as to Hillary Clinton.

Boehlert, reporting in Media Matters – another Soros-funded, leftist organization – wrote on April 7, 2011,</a> in the wake of Beck’s firing, that Color of Change “was instrumental in launching the Beck ad boycott that cost Fox some $40 million in advertising,&#8221; while neglecting to report that Soros either funded the advertiser boycott campaign or participated in funding Color of Change through his Open Society Foundation.</p><p>Another hacked Soros document, a memo from Diana Morris to the U.S. Programs Board of the Open Society Foundation, dated Jan. 30, 2012, makes clear the two-year grant discussed in Vandenberg’s memo cited above was an extension of a pre-existing funding commitment.</p><p>“It is important to recognize U.S. Programs’ primary role of granting money to other organizations,” Morris wrote.</p><p>“While we undertake our own communications and advocacy efforts, we also invest in others to advance open society in the United States. Some grantees, such as the Center or American Progress, Media Matters, and Color of Change, to name a few, are sophisticate communications machines, while other grantees scarcely engage in any communications efforts,” Morris continued. “There was broad agreement in the working group that it is important to strengthen grantee communications efforts.”</p><p>Yet another hacked document, the briefing book for the Open Society Foundation U.S. Programs Board scheduled to meet in New York City on Sept. 29-30, 2014, makes clear on page 40 that Soros continued to fund Color of Change to engage in “political communication” efforts. The document said Color of Change had joined ACLU, referred to as another Open Society Foundation “anchor grantee,” in being “nationally and locally active in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown.”</p><p>Since 2009, <a href=\" https://www.activistfacts.com/organizations/524-color-of-change/\">Soros ’ Open Society Foundation has given $550,000 to Color for Change and its parent organization, Citizen Engagement Laboratory</a>, CEL. The groups have been identified as seeking to mobilize minority citizens to expand their political voice through use of the Internet as “champions of suppressed and disadvantaged individuals in order to advance their progressive political agenda,” implementing strategies that include using Soros dollars to rally leftist supporters to vote.</p><p><b>Beck &#8216;fired for attacking Soros&#8217;</b></p><p>In June 2011, when Glenn Beck was fired from his highly popular, hour-long weekday show on Fox News, <a href=\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/30/glenn-beck-fox-news-last-show_n... Huffington Post attributed the firing</a> to “an aggressive campaign that caused up to 400 advertisers to drip their support of the show, although news sources at the time did not identify Soros as the culprit.</p><p>Two years later, in May 2013, WND presented evidence Beck was fired because he dared to attack Soros on air.</p><p><a href=\" http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/noel-sheppard/2012/01/14/bill-moyers-geo... a Huffington Post interview</a>, longtime PBS news commentator Bill Moyers defended Soros, charging the billionaire had “been the victim, of course, of Glenn Beck and the right-wing, the Fox News assassins.”</p><p>Beck responded: “Here’s the real reason why George Soros is worried about little old me and the assassins, because I know the truth about him.</p><p>“Everyone – including the assassins [at Fox News] – told me, ‘You wanna shut up about George Soros?’</p><p>“No. No I don’t. Nope. Doesn’t make my life easier. Doesn’t make me more popular. Doesn’t do anything, except I am allowed to end my days saying I told the truth. I did what somebody should have done and tell the truth. The truth has no agenda. The truth will set you free. The truth needs to be held like a sword and a shield. He should be worried. He should be worried because I’m going to continue to expose him when he finds out the role he plays in our next little book coming out this spring. He’ll be up all night on the phone with Bill Moyers crying himself to sleep.”</p><p>In June 2011, WND reported that Jewish Funds for Justice, the charity WND had identified as leading the crusade demanding Fox News fire Beck, was backed by Soros and tied to many of the liberal activists that Beck routinely excoriates on his program.</p><p>WND noted Jewish Funds for Justice delivered a petition with 10,000 signatures to Fox News in protest of a program in which Beck called Soros a “puppet master.” JFSJ deemed the show anti-Semitic.</p><p>In 2009, the Open Society provided a $150,000 grant to JFSJ and its associated group, the Funder’s Collaborative on Youth Organizing. In 2010, the Open Society provided a $200,000 grant to last a period of two years.</p><p><b>MSNBC axed Buchanan over book controversy</b></p><p>In February 2012, <a href=\" http://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/msnbc-axes-pat-buchanan-073014\">Po... reported</a> MSNBC had finally reached a decision to sever relations with Buchanan permanently after 10 years, supposedly over a controversy surrounding his book, “Suicide of a Superpower: Will America Survive to 2025?”</p><p><a href=\" http://www.theamericanconservative.com/2012/02/16/blacklisted-but-not-be... a piece published in the American Conservative in Februrary 2012 titled “Blacklisted, But Not Beaten,”</a> Buchanan agreed that his firing began “almost immediately” with the Oct. 18 publication of the book. He correctly identified the culprit as Color of Change, a group existing “to strengthen Black America’s political voice,” which charged his book espoused a “white supremacist ideology.&#8221;</p><p>Buchanan said Color of Change &#8220;took particular umbrage at the title of Chapter 4, ‘The End of White America.’”</p><p>Buchanan defended the thesis of the book, arguing, “America is Balkanizing, breaking down along the lines of religion, race, ethnicity, culture, and ideology and that Western peoples are facing demographic death by century’s end.”</p><p>He further commented that the modus operandi of “the thought police at Color of Change” is to brand as racist “any writer who dares to venture outside the narrow corral in which they seek to confine debate.”</p><p>Commenting on Color of Change’s efforts to remove him from MSNBC, Buchanan wrote: “I know these blacklisters. They operate behind closed doors, with phone calls, mailed threats, and off-the-record meetings. They work in the dark because, as Al Smith said, nothing un-American can live in the sunlight.”</p><p>As early as Jan. 9, 2012, WND had reported that Color of Change was behind the movement to oust Buchanan from MSNBC.</p><p>In that article <a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/2012/01/critics-claim-msnbc-has-suspended-pat-buchana... reported</a> Color of Change was pressing to have Buchanan removed from MSNBC, citing an online statement published by the group’s executive director, Rashad Robinson, who demanded &#8220;it’s time for MSNBC to permanently end their relationship with Pat Buchanan and the hateful, outdated ideas he represents.”</p><p><b>Color of Change&#8217;s boasts</b></p><p><a href=\" https://colorofchange.org/campaigns/victories/glennbeck/\">In a statement still published on the group’s website</a>, Color of Change boasts that beginning in 2009, the group forced Beck off cable television.</p><p>“Beck legitimized disproven, racist ideas about the role of Black people in society by integrating them into mainstream political conversations,” the statement reads. “White supremacists praised him for helping to make their ideas more respectable and widespread. And he did it with the support of hundreds of major corporations that advertised on his show. No one was fighting back effectively; our movement didn’t have an answer to Glenn Beck.”</p><p>Color of Change openly admits running an economic campaign to drive Beck off Fox News, claiming it was launched in July 2008 when Beck called President Obama a “racist” with a “deep-seated hatred for white people.”</p><p>Some 285,000 people signed a Color of Change petition to Beck’s advertisers demanding Beck be removed from Fox News.</p><p>Color of Change described the campaign against Beck:</p><blockquote><p>Within days of Beck’s attack on President Obama, tens of thousands of Color Of Change members were signing our petition to all of Beck’s advertisers, channeling our outrage into meaningful and strategic leverage over Fox News. At the same time, behind the scenes, our staff initiated a dialogue with some of Beck’s biggest advertisers, corporations including Walmart, CVS, Best Buy and Sprint. We conveyed to them the concerns of our members, and presented them with a clear choice: stop funding Beck, or become publicly associated with his racism and divisiveness. We partnered with Media Matters to track ads on Beck’s show, and worked with organizations including CREDO Action, MoveOn and Jewish Funds for Justice to draw more people into the campaign and increase the pressure.</p><p>Most companies moved quickly to pull their ads, once they understood the power of our members to hold them accountable. When a corporation refused, our members took action, flooding them with hundreds of phone calls, and spreading content and commentary on social media that linked their brand to Beck and his attacks on Black people. Nearly every corporation we targeted pulled their ads. The victories snowballed, continuing for months.</p></blockquote><p><i><a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/hill-and-bill-exposed-as-partners-in-crime-4-...

Who will win the race for the White House? Sound off in today&#8217;s WND poll</em></strong></a></p><p>&#8216;<b>I owe $100,000 and want vindication&#8217;</b></p><p>A former student who was 24 when she enrolled in Walden University in 2006 to pursue a graduate degree in psychology told her story to WND on condition of anonymity.</p><p>&#8220;Walden University was constantly on my computer screen advertising and popping up on me,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Finally, I called them. There was an enrollment adviser who would call me constantly.&#8221;</p><p>The Walden University adviser promised her that she would have a Ph.D. within five years.</p><p>&#8220;I was young, broke and desperate,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I figured maybe this would be a great opportunity for me to one day make lots of money as a Ph.D. and take care of my family. He called so much, I decided to enroll. It was a huge mistake.&#8221;</p><p>What she encountered was constant demands to take costly additional courses.</p><p>&#8220;I started to be blocked from classes if I didn&#8217;t get more financial aid,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;I was constantly adding to my debt and financial aid. I stopped even looking at the amount of the loans because I desperately wanted out of the program and fast. Three years into the program, I realized Walden had not even granted me a masters even though I had completed all the courses required for a masters and was eight classes into my Ph.D. program.&#8221;</p><p>Next, she found herself in a seemingly never-ending process of revising her doctoral thesis.</p><p>&#8220;I found myself constantly enrolled in thesis writing that ended up involving some eight different advisers,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I would be sent back the same document with no helpful commentary. It would be the same document after I changed it several times and no helpful remarks from the professors. None.&#8221;</p><p>After eight different advisers, she found herself stonewalled, unable to recruit another Walden University professor to be her adviser.</p><p>&#8220;I found myself emailing random people to see if they [would] be my thesis professor. Then they would not communicate at all, and I&#8217;d be left with a paper that was that the university told me was not good enough.&#8221;</p><p>She continued: &#8220;I got upset, and I started calling and emailing to get answers. I was hung up on many times, yelled at, and dismissed by ombudsman. I just wanted to know where my Masters was because, at this point, I just wanted out. I called and called.&#8221;</p><p>Finally, in 2009, she &#8220;was told that if I paid more money, I&#8217;d be done.&#8221;</p><p>Instead of a Ph.D., Walden ultimately gave her a master&#8217;s degree.</p><p>&#8220;I asked my poor mom to please give me the money just so I could get out, though without my Ph.D.,&#8221; she said, concluding her story. &#8220;But I am stronger now, smarter and know better. I know Walden stole from me. I owe over $100,000 in student debt, and I hope one day there will be vindication.&#8221;</p><p><b>10 years without a degree</b></p><p>A similar story comes from L. Essence Pryor, a high-school teacher.</p><p>&#8220;It has been a long 10 years for me at Walden University, and now I’m over $100,000 in student loans, all without a degree,&#8221; Pryor explained.</p><p>&#8220;All of my coursework has been completed, and I have had a change of three chairs and six co-chairs, not to mention lag in response and a firing of one of my professors who had been with me 3+ years before Walden University fired her,&#8221; Pryor continued. &#8220;The new chair gave me an unsatisfactory grade even though the quality of my work had not changed.&#8221;</p><p>Pryor has complained to Walden but without satisfaction.</p><p>&#8220;I have contacted Walden about this situation, but the university has still not given me a firm timeline to finish, nor offered to compensate me for at least one year while I finish my degree,&#8221; Pryor said. &#8220;What Walden asked in return was for me to sign a release agreeing not to sue them.&#8221;</p><p>Walden insisted Pryor had to sign the release before the university would resume her graduate program.</p><p>When Pryor refused, Walden declined to resume her graduate studies or to allow her to receive a degree, despite 10 years of effort and $100,000 in accumulated student debt attending the university.</p><p><b>&#8216;I panicked, took a leave of absence, and was severely depressed&#8217;</b></p><p>Helene Carrington is a student who enrolled at Walden in 2008 and participated in a class-action suit, Travis et al v. Walden University LLC, filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Maryland and dismissed in 2015.</p><p>Carrington sent WND the statement of her case that she submitted as her testimony in the class-action case.</p><p>She testified she had been enrolled at Walden University since the fall term of 2008 in the Doctorate of Education program with specialization in administration and leadership for teacher learning.</p><p>She said, however, she was currently enrolled in the Educational Specialization (Ed.S.) program, a lesser degree program in the same area of study.</p><p>&#8220;I successfully completed all coursework toward my Doctorate Degree in Education after the Fall Term of 2010 (9/7-12/26),&#8221; she said.</p><p>Carrington entered the proposal/dissertation stage from the spring term of 2011 through the summer term of 2014.</p><p>&#8220;I completed a total of 10 out of 11 successful proposal/dissertation terms according to Walden University guidelines/transcripts,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I received the only &#8216;U&#8217; for &#8216;unsatisfactory&#8217; grade during the summer term (5/6-8/25). The same chair member who gave me this &#8216;U&#8217; had passed me on successfully, although there is no difference in my performance or lack thereof. I argued the point with the chair to no avail.&#8221;</p><p>The unsatisfactory grade sent Carrington into a crisis.</p><p>&#8220;Because of this &#8216;U,&#8217; I panicked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I took a leave of absence, as I was severely depressed and unsure of what I needed to do. I then decided to complete a petition for a different chair and was granted one.&#8221;</p><p>She returned to school in January 2014 and completed two successful terms under her new chair, even though she found the guidance, communication and assistance completely different than she had received from her previous chair.</p><p>&#8220;I was angry after the first successful term under the new chair and proceeded to see what could be done to recoup anything, whether it be time, money, or a grade change through what Walden called a Tuition Waiver Petition,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;I argued my case numerous times, was denied the waiver and then I appealed it, but was also denied.&#8221;</p><p>The cost of continuing her doctorate program forced Carrington to settle for the lesser degree.</p><p>&#8220;The cost of tuition at that time was $5,108 per term,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;Clearly, I did not have the ability to borrow, as I was denied a secondary loan. The only solution I found was to switch programs and seek the Ed.S Degree, which was not my intent. However, I felt it was the only scenario available to me.&#8221;</p><p>Carrington paid Walden $4,470 for the spring term in 2011, only to find the tuition increased each term, ultimately costing $5,100 for the summer 2014 term.</p><p>&#8220;I would estimate that I paid $35,000 in extra costs, given the delays I faced, with what I calculate were seven terms of study that I really didn’t have to take to complete the original doctorate program,&#8221; she wrote.</p><p>She noted the two chair professors she was forced to work with were like &#8220;day and night&#8221; in how they treated her.</p><p><i><a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/2016/07/hill-and-bill-exposed-as-partners-in-crime-4-...

We shouldn&#8217;t have to go through this, but she did that.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;This is the segment of emails that I had to have people in my office read-in to particular programs to even see these emails,” McCullough responded. “We didn&#8217;t posses the required clearances.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;So even the Inspector General for ODNI (Office of the Director of National Intelligence) didn&#8217;t have the requisite security clearances?&#8221; Chaffetz pressed, seeking to clarify McCullough’s statement.</p><p>&#8220;That&#8217;s correct.

It would enable them to avoid the risk of paying coyotes and criminal gangs to travel through Mexico and across the U.S. southern border.</p><p>Unnamed U.S. officials told reporters prior to Biden’s announcement that children deemed refugees would be allowed to work immediately upon entry in the U.S. and apply for permanent residency the next year and for naturalization five years later.</p><p>WND further reported Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., criticized Obama’s plan to extend refugee status to Central American children as “simply a government-granted border surge.”</p><p>Goodlatte said that under the “abusive new policy, unlawful immigrants in the United States, once they are granted executive amnesty by the president, can now rely on the Obama administration to bring their child, and possibly their spouse, who are in Central America to our country.”</p><p>In April 2015, WND reported the Obama administration was preparing to implement a new program to the United States at taxpayer expense for unaccompanied minors from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras if the “children” under 21 have a parent legally residing in the United States.</p><p>Last month, <a href=\" http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/07/13/feds-report-growth-pr... reported</a> more than 7,300 immigrant parents have applied to have the U.S. government fly their children from Central America to the states at taxpayer expense.

There isn’t a person in there anywhere, no discernible person with feelings, conviction or authenticity.”</p><p>Last week, Twitter permanently banned Yiannopoulos from its social-media platform after a Twitter run-in with Ghostbusters actress Leslie Jones.</p><p>“With the cowardly suspension of my account, Twitter has confirmed itself as a safe space for Muslim terrorists and Black Lives Matter extremists, but a no-go zone for conservatives,” Yiannopoulos said.</p><p>“Like all acts of the totalitarian left, this will blow up in their faces, netting me more adoring fans,” he said. “We’re winning the culture war, and Twitter just shot themselves in the foot.”</p><p><b>&#8216;Trump is real&#8217;</b></p><p>Yiannopoulos contrasted Clinton with his impression of Trump.</p><p>“Trump, for better or worse, is there,” he said. “Trump is real and you can sort of put your hands on him. You can get the measure of Trump. You can get a hold of him in your head conceptually. You can understand what Trump is.”</p><p>Yiannopoulos acknowledged that Trump is not universally popular among Republicans and is largely disdained by establishment media.</p><p>“Some of the older Republican people are struggling to do it, but it seems like everybody else is figuring it out just fine,” he said. “It’s only media and politicians that don’t get it. It’s easier to get a handle on Trump. Then you can decide if you like him or you don’t.”</p><div id=\"attachment_3535164\" style=\"width: 337px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"/files/2016/07/milo-yiannopoulos.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3535164\"><img class=\"wp-image-3535164\" src=\" http://www.wnd.com/files/2016/07/milo-yiannopoulos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"327\" height=\"549\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Milo Yiannopoulos at the Republican National Convention July 21, 2016 (WND photo)</p></div><p>He characterized Hillary as “a constantly shifting patchwork quilt of positions, and corruption, and weirdness,” adding that he finds it difficult to get a handle on her.</p><p>“I don’t really like to vote based on identity politics, but it’s very clear to me that Donald Trump is the most gay-friendly candidate for president in American electoral history,” Yiannopoulos said. “Certainly the most gay-friendly candidate the Republicans have ever run for president, and maybe the mot gay-friendly candidate to run for president ever.”</p><p>Yiannopoulos noted that while he had little time to socialize at the gay party he held during the Republican National Convention, he particularly enjoyed “that there were a lot of left-wing journalists there and their minds were exploding.”</p><p>He elaborated on the theme.</p><p>“The mainstream media can’t comprehend how gays could be so ungrateful as to turn their backs on the left,” he said. “The media at the party couldn’t comprehend how I could like Trump.”</p><p>He said it&#8217;s &#8220;perfectly obvious to me why gay people would like Trump.&#8221;</p><p>“I mean, he’s the drag queen you could vote for. He’s over the top and fabulous, and clownish, and brash. He says what everyone is thinking. He’s taboo shattering.</p><p>“There’s a sort of contiguous line in style and substance from dissident gay culture in the 1960s, 70s and 80s that leads straight into Donald Trump. Look at the way he decorates his apartments. He’s so gay.”</p><p><b>Who would keep gay people safe?</b></p><p>Shifting gears, Yiannopoulos said there&#8217;s a serious reason why the LGBT community must support Trump.</p><p>“If you cut emotion and the brainwashing of the left out of it, and just look at who would keep gay people safe, I think supporting Trump is pretty obvious,” he argued.</p><p>“Hillary is definitely a lesbian,” he continued. “She has those cold, dead eyes that only lesbians have. There’s a unique kind of socio-pathology that I have observed in lesbians in my 30 years of life, and Hillary Clinton has it.”</p><p>He expanded on the theme.</p><p>“It’s a particular look behind the eyes, the look of constantly shifting surfaces,” he observed.</p><p>“When you grasp the person behind the hairdo, you can’t get a finger on it, but you know there’s ‘no there’ there,” he said. “There’s no person in Hillary Clinton who cares about anything. You can’t believe anything they say. And there’s no sense that there’s ever any authenticity, or realness or sincerity.”</p><p>He noted he has given considerable thought contemplating Clinton&#8217;s psychology.</p><p>“Male socio-pathology takes a slightly different form,” he said. “It’s characterized by an excessive bluster and will, and competitiveness. But female socio-pathology is a sort of cold wrath that men sometimes lack. That’s a lesbian thing, and Hillary has it.”</p><p><b>GOP &#8216;mental breakdown&#8217; over Trump</b></p><p>Yiannopoulos said he enjoys watching Trump cause consternation within the GOP.</p><p>“Two things are going on at this convention,” he observed. “One is the continuation of the Republican Party’s mental breakdown over Donald Trump. Some are trying to reconcile themselves to the engine of chaos and figure out if they can stick it. The rest of them are just having a meltdown, and it’s very enjoyable to watch for those of us who think the Republican Party deserve a bit of punishment.</p><p>The other thing, he said, is &#8220;happening more on the fringes and the events outside the convention floor that seem to me to be more about culture than politics.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;The gays for Trump parties and the other things that are going on are sending a powerful message to Trump and the Democrats that certain constituencies they thought they owned really don’t belong to them anymore,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and they are going to have to start fighting for their votes, whether it’s women, or blacks, or gays, you name it.”</p><p>Yiannopoulos explained to WND why he feels the controversy over Trump has given the GOP new life.</p><p>“This is a very glamorous convention in many ways,” he said.</p><p>“You see a lot of women in beautiful dresses – you’ve got diamonds and silk – you’ve got all kinds of colorful, dramatic, glamorous characters the likes of which the Republican Party hasn’t seen for a while,” he said.</p><p>“You’ve always had people dressed in pearls, rich wives, that sort of thing, but the youthful glamour – and in some cases the slightly trashy glamour – is pretty new to Republican politics. It’s very exciting. The whole place feels like it’s colorful, it’s alive. It feels like something is happening.”</p><p>Yiannopoulos believes Trump has the ability to reconfigure the GOP in a positive way.</p><p>“Trump, for me, isn’t particularly reimagining the Republican Party as building an entirely new one,” he said. “Whether or not the GOP can accommodate itself around what Trump is building, or whether these two sorts of things are simply irreconcilable, or whether something else happens is going to become clearer over the next couple of months.”</p><p>He believes the conflict over Trump is healthy in that the GOP needs to be reformed, with a new era of conservatism about to give birth among those under 40.</p><p>“What’s good about this convention is that the factions have confronted one another; they know what they’re up against now, they’ve looked each other in the eye, and they know what the friends and enemies look like,” he said.</p><p>“Now it’s a question for the base, for the voters, for the public at large, the Republicans and the independents that Trump is scooping up to decide what the future of the right wing in this country is going to look like,” he commented.</p><p>“It seems to me like it’s probably going to be economically conservative, probably there’s no space for hawkish foreign policy anymore, and certain kinds of social conservatism in the Republican Party are dead and never coming back among anyone under 40.”</p><p>WND asked Yiannopoulos if he was troubled by the GOP platform&#8217;s stance on LGBT issues.</p><p>“People have asked me if I’m troubled by the anti-gay flavor of the platform, and see it as a positive because it’s kind of like a dying last gasp,” he responded. “This is the last chance they’re every going to get so they’re going full tilt.”</p><p>Furthermore, he said, &#8220;Trump is going to throw it all out, so who cares?”</p><p>“It doesn’t bother me, but it is quite clear there are established interests in the Republican Party that are having last gasps – last ditch attempts to save the party they want which seems truly a detriment the way we’re heading,&#8221; he said.</p><p><b>Millennials: libertarians versus authoritarians</b></p><p>Yiannopoulos believes the Millennial support for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Party is only the beginning of the massive impact that generation will have on the U.S. politics of the future.</p><p>“There’s plenty of people under 40 who believe the entire political media and academic establishment deserves to burn, and they don’t make particularly a distinction between the Republican and Democratic Party,” he said.</p><p>“We’re going to mess up politics in an entirely new way than the current generation has messed up politics,” he quipped. “I don’t think the American political system is quite ready for what young voters really want – a total realignment along libertarian vs. authoritarian lines rather than left and right.”</p><p>He elaborated on the impact he believes Millennials are beginning to have on U.S. politics.</p><p>“Young people have some vague awareness and remembrance of the religious right in the 1990s, that were saying video games can make you violent,” he noted. “They have some awareness in the last couple of years of the left saying video games can make you sexist. They know that all this is nonsense.</p><p>“They know that when the right says Marilyn Manson is responsible for school shootings, they know this is barking mad baloney. And Millennials are tired of being told what to do, and say, and be, and what they can read, and who they can hang out with, how they dress, and what language they can use. They are really, really sick of it, the vast majority of them.”</p><p>He does not believe left vs. right will define the politics of the future.</p><p>“It seems to me there are some minor differences among young people along political or ideological lines,” he commented. “But what really divides anyone under 40 in this country now is whether they are libertarian or authoritarian.”</p><p>He believes the political left has become totalitarian in its beliefs.</p><p>“In the past 10 years, which party is the guiltiest of wanting to run everyone else’s lives has changed, it’s flipped, switched very dramatically,” he said. “To the point now that if you want to be alternative, and punk and cool, you buy a ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.”</p><p>Remarkably, Yiannopoulos sees conservatives today as more hip than the radicals on the political left.</p><p>“Conservatives have claimed that being right-wing was alternative for some time, but it has never really been true until Trump,” he said. “And now it is. Now all of the coolest, all of the funniest, smartest, sassiest, cattiest, most fascinating and fabulous people are all Trump fans.”</p><p><b>&#8216;The Madonna model&#8217;</b></p><p>In the interview, Milo made clear to WND he had given considerable thought to constructing his political persona.</p><p>“I identified quite early on what I think other conservatives were getting wrong,” he insisted.</p><p>“And I took the approach that if I wanted to reach a lot of people and take everybody at least some of the way, rather than taking a couple of people all the way, that I needed to treat my style, my career – everything about the Milo brand – as an entertainment brand,” he said. “I needed to consider myself an entertainment personality, not a journalist, not a researcher, not a writer. So that’s what I’ve done. I wouldn’t discount music and acting in the future.”</p><p>He said the Bill Maher types will soon have competition from the right.</p><p>“The left has had this hybrid comedian-activist-journalist for some time now, but there has not been a compelling example of this on the right – I don’t think ever,” he said. “People have tried, but I don’t think they’ve captured the imagination of the average person.”</p><p>Yiannopoulos said he’s modeled his career after the entertainer Madonna.</p><p>“So, I’ve taken the view there are two kinds of star,” he explained. “There is the star who is the best at what they do, better than anybody else on the planet. And they tend to be very damaged people, like Amy Winehouse, or whatever. They crash and burn very early. They have transcendent gifts, but with their genius goes the madness.”</p><p>He agreed this was a form of the Daedalus Complex, with the brilliant burning out early by getting too close to the sun and that he preferred to emulate what he understood was Madonna’s approach to her career.</p><p>“Madonna is not the best at anything, but she is above average with everything,” he stressed.</p><p>&#8220;She’s a bit of a better singer than everybody else. She’s a bit better looking than everybody else. She’s a little bit better than everyone else at most things. But she works so hard. She works way harder than everybody else, and she’s way brilliant at assembling talent around herself.”</p><p>Milo made clear he is preparing for a long and successful career.</p><p>“I work very hard, but I try to make it look effortless – and I generally succeed,” he said. “The second type of star, the Madonna type of star, that’s the star that has a 40-year career. That’s the kind of star that at age 40 or 50 is worth $500 million and has global deals, long-running contracts, and becomes a cultural icon – rather than being a niche star that crashes and burns early.”</p><p>He continued: “So, I’ve always followed the Madonna model. I know I’m not the hottest, not the funniest, not the smartest, and I’m not the best at anything. In any given room, I won’t beat everyone at anything, and I probably won’t be the best at anything, but I work harder than everybody else. And I’m very good at assembling smart, talented people around me to do the things I can’t do. And I have so much fun at it.”</p><p>He expressed satisfaction with what he has achieved so far.</p><p>“I have the best job in the world,” he said. “I get to wind up the worst people in the world and I get paid for it. I get paid for making the lives of the worst people a misery.”</p> Posted: 1 month 6 days ago George Noory of 'Coast-to-Coas... \n<div id=\"attachment_1206385\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1206385\" src=\" http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/09/140905georgenoory.jpg\" alt=\"George Noory\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"/files/2014/09/140905georgenoory-300x150.jpg 300w, /files/2014/09/140905georgenoory-340x170.jpg 340w, /files/2014/09/140905georgenoory-126x63.jpg 126w, /files/2014/09/140905georgenoory-172x86.jpg 172w, /files/2014/09/140905georgenoory.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">George Noory</p></div><p>NEW YORK – George Noory, the host of the widely acclaimed &#8220;Coast-to-Coast AM&#8221; radio show that is syndicated nationally on more than 600 radio stations, has found a new career with the publication of his first novel, &#8220;Night Talk.&#8221;</p><p>The story, a science-fiction mystery, features Greg Nowell, a late-night host broadcasting from Los Angeles who serves as a thinly disguised alter-ego for Noory himself.</p><p>Nowell&#8217;s fictional late-night radio show, much like Noory&#8217;s &#8220;Coast-to-Coast AM,&#8221; holds listeners spellbound and fascinated by tackling controversial topics, ranging from the political to the paranormal.</p><p>The action starts fast, when in the first few pages a brilliant but emotionally unstable computer hacker with a history of interesting but disturbing appearances on Nowell&#8217;s radio show comes crashing out of a window on the opposite side of the street from where Nowell broadcasts in an apparent suicide.

Ted Cruz hurt himself when he spoke at the meetings, but refused to endorse 2016 candidate Donald Trump.</p><p>They believe it will be very hard for him, if it is at all possible, to get funding or political support for another run at the GOP nomination for president in 2020 or 2024.</p><p>Or possibly even his effort to be re-elected to a second term in the U.S. Senate in 2018.</p><p>Some donors who spoke to WND said they probably would be unwilling to fund Cruz&#8217;s political future.</p><p>It was after Cruz won the Texas primary that the 155 Texas delegates to the Republican Convention came to Cleveland very enthusiastic over their own senator.</p><p>Some two-thirds of the delegates were committed to voting for Cruz on the first ballot. The rest were going for Trump.</p><p>But then came the non-endorsement, and Cruz even doubled down the next morning by saying his pledge to support the eventual GOP candidate didn&#8217;t go so far as to get support from him for someone who insulted his wife and father.</p><p>He stopped by a private lunch involving top GOP donors in a hotel close to Quicken Arena, where the convention was held, to lobby his case.</p><p>He pleaded that his goal was to reach beyond the convention floor to speak with conservatives across America, in an attempt to position himself as the leader of what he perceives as a continuing and strong conservative movement within the GOP.</p><p>Donors largely were unconvinced. They emphasized the importance of beating Hillary Clinton as a unifying theme now, asking Cruz repeatedly what Trump had to do specifically to win his endorsement.</p><p>Cruz declined to answer, responding only that in his speech he had made clear he joined the GOP in the conclusion that Hillary Clinton must be defeated.</p><p><em><a href=\" http://superstore.wnd.com/Time-For-Action-Empowering-the-Faithful-to-Rec... you think Ted Cruz is a champion of conservative values &#8230; wait until you read his dad&#8217;s new book! Get your copy of &#8220;A Time for Action: Empowering the Faithful to Reclaim America&#8221; at the WND Superstore</a></em></p><p>The donors pressed Cruz, stressing that if he hoped to reverse the damage done by his speech, he would endorse promptly and directly.</p><p>They expressed worry Cruz was pursuing an unwise course of action, possibly even against the advice of the party, supporters and donors.</p><p><b>Delegates disappointed</b></p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Cruz supporter and I am disappointed,&#8221; Ken Cope a Texas delegate told WND in an exclusive interview on the convention floor.</p><p>&#8220;We were led to believe we were going to get from Cruz some kind of a statement of support for Trump, but we didn&#8217;t get that,&#8221; Cope continued, making it clear he was not pleased Cruz refrained from a direct endorsement of Trump.</p><p>&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t need to be a distraction for us in the GOP and it won&#8217;t be a distraction in Texas. We are getting over it,&#8221; Cope stressed. &#8220;With or without Ted Cruz, we are focused on making sure we don&#8217;t allow Hillary Clinton to get in the White House, or even anywhere near close to it.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Hillary Clinton needs to go to the &#8216;big house,&#8217; not the White House,&#8221; he continued.</p><p>&#8220;We’re a broad party. &#8216;Welcome Home to the Republican Party&#8217; is what our message needs to be. We need to be focusing on the real issues – jobs, women&#8217;s rights, the security of our borders, economic development, and international security. Voters are concerned with how these issues affect their lives. We cannot afford four more years of the Obama administration under the title of Hillary. Our country will not survive that.</p><p>&#8220;From a distraction point of view, we&#8217;re putting Cruz behind us, it&#8217;s over and we’re going forward to win this election,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are moving forward with a strong Donald Trump-Mike Pence team with themes that will appeal to American voters and to conservatives with the party. Ted Cruz will have to repair the damage he did within the Texas GOP if he wants to have a chance running again for the Senate in 2018.&#8221;</p><p>Dan Pickens, a Texas delegate committed to Cruz told WND he would not exactly say he was &#8220;unhappy&#8221; Cruz did not endorse Trump.</p><p>&#8220;I have worked in Ted&#8217;s campaign for the Senate and I know him quite well,&#8221; Pickens said. &#8220;It just would have been better if Ted had endorsed Donald.&#8221;</p><p>WND asked Pickens if the relationship between Cruz and Trump could be patched up.</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to matter in the long term at all,&#8221; Pickens responded. &#8220;The people supporting Ted understand the consequences of voting for Hillary and they&#8217;re going to vote for Donald any way you look at it, and they will work for Donald, as I will.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I could easily have been a Texas delegate for Cruz, but I was not,&#8221; Pickens continued. &#8220;I really don&#8217;t know, but it could affect his chances of getting re-elected in Texas. Right now, I would say, there are some people in the delegation who are very unhappy with Ted but I think this thing is going to blow over. What I know is that the Texas delegation is unified in the need to get out the vote to defeat Hillary.&#8221;</p><p>A few agreed with Cruz&#8217;s actions.</p><p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect Ted Cruz to endorse Trump,&#8221; Texas delegate Sandra Ziegler explained to WND. &#8220;If someone had spoken about my husband and family the way Donald Trump spoke about Cruz, I wouldn&#8217;t endorse him either.&#8221;</p><p>Ziegler identified with what she saw as Cruz&#8217;s strategy to communicate with conservatives.</p><p>&#8220;What Cruz did was lost on a lot of people in this convention because they are so intent on all of us picking up the pompoms for Mr. Trump, is that Ted Cruz articulated a way forward for conservatives,&#8221; she stressed.</p><p>&#8220;Cruz was speaking to conservatives all across the country,&#8221; Ziegler said. &#8220;Cruz&#8217;s audience was the people at home more than the people in this convention hall. It was a very brave thing for Ted Cruz to do.&#8221;</p><p>Ziegler argued that Cruz&#8217;s strategy will ultimately rebound to benefit Trump&#8217;s presidential candidacy.</p><p>&#8220;He articulated a way for conservatives who feel like I do to support Trump even though we feel we cannot pick up the pompoms for Donald Trump the way we would normally for our Republican candidate,&#8221; she said.</p><p>&#8220;Cruz suggested we could unite around ideas, and in his speech to the convention Cruz articulated those ideas,&#8221; Ziegler insisted. &#8220;Cruz identified the planks of Mr. Trump&#8217;s platform that he agrees with – the need to build a wall, the fact that the deal with Iran is a bad deal, the need to fight terrorism and keep people safe. Cruz did Trump a favor by giving conservatives a way to support the ideas Trump stands for, even if they can&#8217;t support the man.&#8221;</p><p>Dale Attebery, another Texas delegate, agreed with Ziegler.</p><p>&#8220;Ted Cruz can do no wrong in my mind,&#8221; Attebery explained to WND. &#8220;My reaction is that Ted Cruz did pretty much what I would have done. Ted said he is not going to vote for Hillary Clinton, and that he is going to vote with the Republican ticket. So what is the problem?&#8221;</p><p>Attebery stressed there still is time.</p><p>“Not everything had to be done last night,&#8221; Attebery continued. &#8220;We have all August, September, and October yet to go. There is plenty of time. Cruz can come out at any time he wants, with any endorsement he wants, but I would not have done any difference if my family had been attacked on a personal basis. I might have done more that Ted Cruz did.&#8221;</p><p>Texas delegate John Bines was convinced Ted Cruz hurt himself, and the GOP.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hearing so many people saying how angry they are that Cruz won&#8217;t just support the party now,&#8221; Bines said. &#8220;Cruz is trying to make it sound like he is just so principled, but at this point there&#8217;s only two choices for president and there is no reason for Cruz not to get behind Trump.&#8221;</p><p>Texas delegate Donny Wisenbaker was also disappointed.</p><p>&#8220;I think Ted Cruz hurt himself within the Republican Party and within Texas,&#8221; Wisenbaker told WND. &#8220;I would say there are probably 65 percent of us in the Texas delegation who think Cruz should have endorsed Trump. When Cruz spoke to the Texas delegation this morning, he was trying to spin it, but I don’t think the spin took. I know it didn&#8217;t with me.&#8221;</p><p>Wisenbaker identified himself as a Cruz supporter.</p><p>&#8220;I love the guy, Ted Cruz, and what Donald Trump did to him is beyond the pale,&#8221; Wisenbaker insisted. &#8220;But at the same time, this election is greater than my family or my family. This election is about the heart and soul of America. All of us Republicans have to get in there and do whatever we can to prevent Hillary Clinton from being elected. That’s my opinion.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\" http://wnd.com/2016/07/cruz-faces-blowtorch-of-criticism-for-trump-non-e... reported earlier about the blowtorch of criticism facing Cruz following his statements.</a></p><p>&#8220;Lying Ted is a treacherous turncoat,&#8221; political consultant Roger Stone said in an instant message to WND after Cruz had been booed off the RNC stage in Cleveland.</p><p>Stone compared Cruz&#8217;s refusal to endorse Trump to Nelson Rockefeller&#8217;s 1964 refusal to endorse then GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater in a move that permanently damaged Rockefeller&#8217;s presidential ambitions.</p><p>On Thursday, Cruz had been asked about his support for Trump, and his pledge to the GOP nominee.</p><p>&#8220;The day that became abrogated was the day that became personal,&#8221; Cruz said. &#8220;I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.

People averted their eyes from Cruz and his wife as they walked with their security detail on the skybox level of boisterous Republicans. On the donor suite level, people approached Cruz and insulted him, a source told CNN&#8217;s Dana Bash. One state party chairman reacted so angrily that he had to be restrained.

However, the administration has refused to declassify the pages, even in the face of bipartisan support for their release that includes former 9/11 commission members and 73 current representatives and senators.</p><p>“The public has a right to know,” Brakey said after the platform committee adjourned. “It saddens me that, here we are, 15 years later and it sounds like there’s key pieces of information to our understanding of what happened on that day, and the government has been keeping that information from us.”</p><p>As noted by Brian McGlinchey, <a href=\" https://28pages.org/faq/\">who oversees a website devoted to the issue</a>, the 28 pages are an entire section within the official report of the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, not the official 9/11 Commission Report).</p><p>Conducted by the House and Senate intelligence committees, the 838-page report was published in December 2002.

What the canard leaves out is what caused southern secession in the first place.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Why does this matter?&#8221; D’Souza asks. &#8220;After all, it was the South, not the Democrats, who seceded. But the South seceded because its party, the Democratic Party, lost the election. Had the Democrats won, slavery would have been safe and the South would have remained within the union.&#8221;</p><p><b>The Hillary enigma</b></p><p>D&#8217;Souza sees Hillary as the logical extension of the socialist &#8220;fundamental transformation of America&#8221; witness under Barack Obama.</p><p>He reminds that both Hillary and Obama were acolytes who studied at the altar of Saul Alinsky, the original radical &#8220;community organizer&#8221; who taught the left in his book &#8220;Rules for Radicals,&#8221; dedicated to Lucifer, the revolutionary principles of fanning the flames of economic discontent and racial tensions as a means of gaining raw political power.</p><p>&#8220;Hillary is ruthless, she is grasping, she appears to have little empathy or concern for people,&#8221; D&#8217;Souza notes. &#8220;She is old, and mean, and even her laugh is a witch&#8217;s cackle. There is almost nothing appealing about her. How, then, could she be the first choice of progressive Democrats and the apparent frontrunner for winning the presidency in November 2016?&#8221;</p><p>Yet, D’Souza points out, the Hillary enigma is very different than the Obama enigma.</p><p>&#8220;The enigma of Obama was: Who is this guy? In 2008, Obama came out of nowhere,&#8221; he argues. &#8220;Very little was known about his past. What little was known was mostly camouflage. So there was an understandable appetite to learn about him.&#8221;</p><p>In contrast, Hillary has been a national public figure for over three decades now.</p><p>&#8220;With Hillary, however, there is no guesswork about her background, her personality, or her ideology,&#8221; D’Souza points out.</p><p>&#8220;We all know who Hillary Clinton is. She has been part of our public life for a generation now,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;Not only are we all too familiar with her, we are sick of her. Even Democrats seem mildly nauseated; why else would so many of them turn to the Rip Van Winkle candidacy of Bernie Sanders?&#8221;</p><p>D&#8217;Souza is the author of #1 New York Times bestsellers &#8220;America&#8221; (2014) and &#8220;Obama&#8217;s America&#8221; (2012), as well as several more well-known and bestselling books, including &#8220;Illiberal Education,&#8221; (1991), &#8220;The End of Racism&#8221; (1995), &#8220;What&#8217;s So Great About America&#8221; (2002), &#8220;What&#8217;s so Great About Christianity,&#8221; (2007), and &#8220;The Roots of Obama&#8217;s Rage&#8221; (2010).</p><p>He is the creator of the film &#8220;2016: Obama’s America&#8221; (2012) which is the second-highest-grossing all-time political documentary, passing Michael Moore&#8217;s &#8220;An Inconvenient Truth.&#8221; In addition, &#8220;2016&#8221; was No. 6 on the bestselling list of all documentaries.</p><p> ;</p> Posted: 1 month 3 weeks ago Voltairenet.org News Evacuation of jihadists from Daraya... \nThe combatants and the 4,000 civilians of Daraya (a suburb of Damascus, near Mezzeh) have accepted a «reconciliation agreement».
