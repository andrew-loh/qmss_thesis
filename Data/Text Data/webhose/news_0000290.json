It requires n heavy lifting or strong back, but does require a backbone of a different type which congress (republicans, democrats, and independents) have continually demonstrated none of them have. It is this lack of backbone, called honor, that is the reason why we no longer follow the constitution and the rule of law. Every member of congress took an oath to not allow this, yet every member of congress allows the constitution to be just a doormat for the political elite. This is why the president refuses to enforce the law (immigration, espionage, obstruction of justice, perjury, etc.). This is why the IRS was weaponized during an election cycle and to date no one has paid a price for the obliteration of the first amendment. This is why hundreds of people in high places escaped the charge of espionage. Congress. Are you listening? You congress, due to lack of honor, have become an enemy of the people and of the constitution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-15T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-15T16:53:39.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
