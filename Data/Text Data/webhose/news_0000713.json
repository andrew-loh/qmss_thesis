As for perhaps his most controversial proposal on the matter -- building a border wall, and making Mexico pay for it -- Trump said they touched on the issue in their meeting, though he did not insist Wednesday that Mexico foot the bill.\n“We did discuss the wall. We didn’t discuss payment of the wall,” Trump told reporters, while saying either country has a \"right\" to build such a barrier. \nREAD THE FULL STORY AT FOXNEWS.COM! \nRead the full story at the Washington Examiner→", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-08-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T01:13:50.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
