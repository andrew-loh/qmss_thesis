Have you registered to vote?\nIf you’re in Houston, you can kill these two unlikely birds with one stone.\nA fleet of taco trucks have been doubling as voter registration booths throughout the city since Monday.\n‘Register to vote, get a taco’: taco trucks put voter registration booths ‘on every corner’ https://t.co/slRmcGFZOs #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner pic.twitter.com/ppfN3mcxlR \n— CandaceTX (@CandaceTX) September 28, 2016 \n\nThe idea is the brainchild of Thomas Hull, a partner with design firm Rigsby Hull, who teamed up with activisim group Mi Familia Vota-- a group that promotes Latino political involvement—in the wake of controversial comments made earlier this month by Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez.\nDuring an appearance on MSNBC, Gutierrez defended the Republican presidential nominee's immigration policy, saying “My culture is a very dominant culture, and it’s imposing, it’s causing problems. If you don’t do something about it, you’re going to have taco trucks [on] every corner.”\nMany people across social media were outraged but plenty more wondered why taco trucks on every corner would be a bad thing, with #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner becoming a trending topic after the appearance. \nIn the wake of the comments, Hull decided more needed to be done than just create a hashtag or memes. \n“We’re also handing out information on where to vote, with early votes and on Election Day and the process of voting, ’cause that’s–registering folks to vote–is half the battle,\" Hull told Houston Public Media . \"The other half is getting folks to the polls.\"\nThe registration campaign officially opened Monday and will run through Tuesday, Oct. 11. A full list of voter registration site-taco trucks can be found here. \nAnd yes the trucks will still be serving food while they pull double duty as voter registration sites.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-29T21:03:37.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
