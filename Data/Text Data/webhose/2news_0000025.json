Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but that's not okay with me.\" \nThis is mostly false. In 2003, then-Senator Hillary Clinton voted against the federal Partial Birth Abortion Ban, a ban on an abortion procedure known as dilation and extraction that happens later in pregnancy, because it lacked an exception for the woman's health and life. Though it marked a departure from Supreme Court precedent saying such exceptions were required, the law was narrowly upheld, 5-4 by the Supreme Court in 2007, over a bitter dissent by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who said the law put women's health at risk. \nLater abortions are extremely rare. According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 1.3 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks. And 43 states ban abortion when the fetus is viable, or even earlier , some with exceptions for rape, incest, the health of the mother, or fetal abnormality. Even in the handful of states where third-trimester abortions are legal, there are only four publicly-known providers of the later procedure, in Colorado, Maryland and New Mexico.
