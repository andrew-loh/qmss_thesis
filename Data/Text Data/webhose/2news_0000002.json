Four of the last five public polls of the race there showed it to be virtually tied, with Hillary Clinton or Trump leading by just a point. \nBut within that context, his Tuesday visit remains quixotic, since Prescott Valley is in a deep-red county that went nearly 65 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012. And as Trump tends to carry controversy wherever he goes, some Arizona Republicans are wary of his plans. \n\"I dunno if its particularly helpful to anyone here for him to come,\" the Arizona Republican operative said. \n\"Every time he's come [to the state], it kind of sucks up all the energy from everything else going on. If you're not attending [you're asked], 'Why not? Are you distancing yourself?' If you are, it's 'Are you getting too close to him?'\" \nThe operative added: \"It's just kind of annoying from that perspective.\" \nThat was the case in August, when Trump put endangered Arizona Sen. John McCain in a bind by delivering a fiery speech laying out a hard-line immigration policy that effectively called for mass deportation and eliminated any possibility of a pathway to citizenship for those here illegally. \nMcCain was a member of the Gang of Eight group of bipartisan senators that tried and failed to push through Congress a more moderate view of immigration reform, one that included a pathway to citizenship. His advocacy on the issue has drawn him considerable blowback from conservatives and, this cycle, the strongest primary challenge of his career. \nMcCain seems likely at this point to win reelection, and easily outrun Trump — his margin in the polls has expanded even as Trump's has narrowed. \nDealing with the controversy at the top of the ticket, however, hasn't made things easy. \nGrant Woods, a longtime friend of McCain who served as his first chief of staff, said he had spoken to the senator the day after Trump's immigration speech and McCain was less than enthused. \n\"I think its fair to say that he would've preferred that that not happen,\" Woods said when asked if McCain was frustrated with Trump's speech. \nWoods himself was a bit more blunt.
