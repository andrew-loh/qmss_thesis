And I think that's a pretty clear outcome from that trip,\" Clinton added.\nPeña Nieto has said several times since then that he emphatically told the mogul that Mexico will not pay for any wall.\nThe former secretary of state met most recently with Peña Nieto in Mexico in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-06T03:37:10.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
