According to the Turkish government, the country spent over $2.5 billion on the crisis but the international community only provided $525 million so far for Turkey.\nThe European Union, meanwhile, recalled that they have provided financial support to humanitarian organizations but stressed that the EU's ultimate goal is that the refugees seek asylum in EU countries through resettlement and not embarking on dangerous journeys organized by people smugglers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-21T06:01:25.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
