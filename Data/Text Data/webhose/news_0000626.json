The deal to resolve the lawsuit was announced late last week.\nThe agreement included guidelines on how police officers must enforce a contentious section of the law that requires officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally.\nUnder the guidelines, officers are required to document the reasons for their suspicion that a person is in the country illegally.\nCourts barred enforcement of other sections of the law, known as SB 1070, but the questioning requirement was ultimately upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, despite racial profiling concerns raised by critics of the statute.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-20T17:43:38.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
