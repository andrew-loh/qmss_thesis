TRENDING 177,974 VIEWS This Bride’s Broken Zipper Was Fixed By A Syrian Refugee Staying Next Door Master tailor Ibrahim Halil Dudu, who doesn’t speak a word of English, was the unexpected hero of a Canadian wedding. Brad Esposito BuzzFeed News Reporter, Australia 1. Lindsay Coulter, a photographer from Ontario, Canada, was working a wedding when the bride’s dress zipper broke.

ID: 9698066 2. No one at the wedding was able to fix the dress, so they checked in with a neighbour to see if they could help.

A few minutes passed of the bridesmaids attempting to fix the dress themselves, before a knock was heard at the door and the Syrian father and son walked in with a sewing kit.

Lindsay Coulter Photography / Via lindsaycoulterphoto.com “The neighbour David told me they had just moved to Canada four days ago.” \nCoulter told BuzzFeed News the father and son, who don’t speak English, used body language to communicate. \n“Most of the bride’s family was visiting from China, so there was already not much English being spoken. It was really amazing to see everyone communicate through gestures like bowing to say thank you.” ID: 9698077 5. The tailor and father, Ibrahim Halil Dudu, told CTV News he was more than happy to help out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-30T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-29T23:15:51.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
