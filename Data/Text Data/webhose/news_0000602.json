They think that Trump has a magic wand to solve the immigration problem, that deporting 11 millions people is a peace or cake. If he sees the cost to deport only one immigrant plus all people required behind he would be surprise. Does he cares about the Trillion American money he spends? The wall is already there. After what does he want to do for the economy? If he wants to make it higher and more beautiful, what is the change? More Tax money, more debt for Americans, financial crisis, more crimes. Violence will be omnipresent because immigrant would be under covered. Trump forgot that America is a melting pot already. His racial comments has no place in this world. Trying to pursuing his personal greed even at his age 70+ instead of wisdom, Trump is a despicable man. American money is not free. Americans are well aware of Clown Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-08T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-08T01:19:09.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
