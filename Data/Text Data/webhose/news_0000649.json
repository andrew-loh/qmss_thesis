Nu単o advertisement \nA massive new poll sponsored by America's Voice, a non-profit immigrant advocacy organization, and conducted by the polling firm, Latino Decisions, shows that Trump continues to lag far behind Hillary Clinton with Latinos. \nThe poll conducted between August 19th and August 30th, surveyed over 3,700 Latino registered voters. The poll shows that Clinton remains far ahead of Trump in voter favorability, with 68 percent saying they had a favorable view of Clinton and only 21 percent saying they have favorable view of Trump.

Recent reports show expectations of job growth slowed more than expected in August.

By contrast, 56 percent of Latinos see the Democratic Party as caring. \nRelated: Economy Gained Only 151,000 Jobs In August Could Rule Out Rate Hike \nThe poll also highlights a recurring problem with the Latino electorate, with 60 percent of Latino registered voters indicating that they had not been contacted to vote or register by a political campaign or community organization. \nPolitical scientists typically view \"get out the vote\" activities as an important component of voter turnout and can impact an election if turnout is low. Registered voters are typically easier to contact by campaigns and outreach organizations. \nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Stephen A.
