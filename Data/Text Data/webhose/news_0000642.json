The 11th-century minaret of the famed mosque collapsed in April 2013 during fighting. \nThe offensive comes after days of intense airstrikes on rebel-held eastern parts of the city, during which scores of people were killed and a number of buildings demolished. \nOver the weekend, government forces captured the Palestinian refugee camp of Handarat north of the city but rebels regained control of it hours later.
