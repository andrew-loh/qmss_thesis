No arrests were reported. \nAbout 5,400 people live in Lesbos' camps, which were designed for 3,500. The island is very close to Turkey and a main destination for migrants seeking a better life in Europe. \nCamp residents are awaiting processing of their asylum bids. If these are rejected, they face deportation back to Turkey under this year's EU-Turkey deal.
