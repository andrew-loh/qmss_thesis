An undocumented immigrant himself at 9 years old from the Dominican Republic, Senator Espaillat told Alan that he would not have the life that he does now if there was a President Trump in office when he came to America. \nSaying that “America is apple pie”, Senator Espaillat said that this country needs to welcome everyone equally. Stating that there needs to be a comprehensive immigration reform, Senator Espaillat believes that his candidate Hillary Clinton will bring that. Concluding that he believes that the Republican nominee will “tank on election day”, Senator Espaillat shows that anyone can achieve that American dream.
