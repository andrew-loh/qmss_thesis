This is not about “illegals”. This is about legal immigrants who have not yet met the requirements for citizenship. We allow immigrants to serve in our military if they wish to. Just because they served, by their own choice, it does not change their immigration status. Am immigrant who breaks the law is subject to deportation because this violates their immigration agreement. They chose to serve because it is a convenient way to get a paycheck and training for a job, as well as preferential hiring. They are receiving the same benefits as any American citizen for their service. I do not feel we should allow military service by immigrants to become a fast-track to citizenship. This would create a counterproductive culture within the military. If they violate the terms of their immigration they are subject to deportation period, whether they served or not. Those are the rules and anyone who served knows the standard and the consequences for not adhering to it. This issue is about people who violated their own agreement. They do not deserve any sympathy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-10-18T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-10-19T09:10:43.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
