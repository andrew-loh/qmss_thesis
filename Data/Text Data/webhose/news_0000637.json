The large Cuban-American population in South Florida has for years made the Latino community a stronghold for Republicans. But as the older generation dies off and Hispanics from other parts of Latin America – Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela – move to the state, the Democrats have gained an advantage among Latinos. \nPolls show a tied race in Florida, but with Trump still trailing Clinton among Hispanics statewide. A recent survey put Trump ahead of Clinton among Florida’s Cuban-Americans but by a much narrower margin than past Republican presidential nominees. \nA poll released last month by Fox News Latino found that Puerto Ricans seem to have a higher favorability for Hillary Clinton than any other Hispanic group, including Mexican-Americans – who are most affected by Trump’s immigration rhetoric. \nAbout 65 percent of Puerto Ricans, a group expected to play a key role in Florida, viewed Clinton favorably, while only 12 percent had the same view of Trump. The margin of error for Puerto Ricans, however, was plus or minus 8.5 percent. \nOne of Trump’s main challenges in winning over Latinos in Florida is his rhetoric on immigration, which while not a pressing concern to either Cuban-Americans or Puerto Ricans is something that galvanizes the entire U.S. Latino community, experts say. \nFollowing his meeting in Miami, Trump will head to the town of Melbourne in the Republican stronghold of Brevard County. \nLike us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-28T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-27T21:32:22.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
