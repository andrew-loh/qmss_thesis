I'm not saying (journalists) should put aside objectivity; I am saying neutrality is not an option.\"\nIn situations involving \"discrimination, racism, corruption, public lying, dictatorships, human rights, we're obligated to take sides,\" Ramos said in an interview with EFE last March.\nLike us on Facebook \nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-15T15:13:29.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
