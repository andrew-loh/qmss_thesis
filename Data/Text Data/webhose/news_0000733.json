But Utah hasn't gone blue since Lyndon Johnson's landslide victory in 1964. \"People don't understand the Mormon thing. I do. I get it.\" advertisement \nDuring the Democratic primaries, the thousands of Utahns who turned out to see Sen. Bernie Sanders in March suggested there was an audience, or at least an open-mindedness, to Democratic agenda items. According to Tim Chambless , a University of Utah professor of Political Science at the Hinckley Institute of Politics, if the mostly young, first-time voters who overwhelmingly caucused for Sanders show their support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, it could make the difference on Election Day. \nFor his part, Trump's struggles to appeal to Utah's Mormon population highlight the potential hurdles he faces in the state and potentially beyond. \n\"People don't understand the Mormon thing. I do. I get it,\" he insisted in a 2014 New York Times interview, in which he also argued that Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election in part because Christian voters were \" put off \" by his Mormonism.

Recent estimates suggest that while their portion of the population has dropped, it remains in the 60 percent range (a whopping 2 million-plus members ), with the next largest representation, in Idaho, being a distant second with roughly 19 percent. \nMeanwhile, Nevada, which was expected to be a crucial swing state this election cycle, has a Mormon population around 4 percent , which is similar to the margin that currently separates Trump and Clinton in most state polls there. \nThe Mormon population appears to present a perfect storm of affinities that are anathema to Trump's brand: They tend to be disproportionately higher educated , a voting bloc that has resisted Trump to date. Besides their stances on abortion and same-sex marriage, they tend to be much more moderate on issues like immigration and religious tolerance. Speaking of which, Trump's oft-proposed Muslim ban is said to be eerily reminiscent of the persecution Mormons were subjected to centuries ago. And his appeals to evangelicals , who are frequently hostile towards Mormonism , haven't helped either. Mormons purportedly place a priority on the personal values of a candidate — and Trump's history of marital infidelities and tabloid drama hasn't gone over well . The Mormon community also is said to prefer more mild-manner politicians, hence their embrace of former Gov. Jon Huntsman, and so Trump's bombast has backfired with them. Trump's very personal animus directed at Romney , arguably the most prominent Mormon figure in America, has also not endeared him to the community. He has also clashed with other prominent Mormon politicians like Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). The GOP nominee has been on record as blaming Romney's faith in part for his 2012 defeat. \nTrump had one of his worst showings of the 2016 GOP primary race in Utah, finishing a distant third to Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich. And in November, he will not just be competing against Clinton, and Libertarian Gary Johnson, but independent candidate Evan McMullin , as well. (Green Party candidate Jill Stein has yet to qualify for the ballot there.) advertisement \nWhile Clinton has reached out to Mormon community with an op-ed in the Deseret News , it could be Salt Lake City's increasingly diverse, and decidedly less Mormon , population that may be the biggest benefit to her. \nThe city not only boasts an openly gay mayor and an increasingly non-white, multi-lingual population, but its economic success in the tech industry (some have already christened Utah the \"next Silicon Valley\" ) has also attracted younger, more progressive-minded voters from out of state. That group will arguably shape the political identity of the state in coming generations. \nRelated: DNC Expands Footprint in Arizona, Georgia, Utah \nThe shifting population is a trend not unlike what we've seen in several other traditionally red states around the country like Virginia and Colorado — where an influx of college-educated, left-leaning voters into more urban and suburban centers has exerted more influence in our national elections. \nMeanwhile, McMullin, who was born in Provo and is Mormon himself, is expected to over-perform in Utah , even though he has failed to gain traction nationally.
