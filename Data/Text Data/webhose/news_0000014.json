REUTERS/Carlo Allegri CARLO ALLEGRI / Reuters Share advertisement \nThe hope that a some Hispanics were holding onto that Donald Trump could be compassionate toward immigrants vanished with his speech in Arizona. \nSome Hispanics who were backing him or hoped to couldn't justify being in his corner with what they saw as him unleashing law enforcement on immigrants, regardless of whether they were criminals or had lived in the country for years, raised families and paid taxes. \n\"Awful!\" said Massey Villarreal, a Houston businessman who had opposed Trump, then supported him and was done with him after the Tuesday speech. \"As a compassionate conservative, I am disappointed with the immigration speech. \n\"I'm going to flip, but not flop. I am no longer supporting Trump for president, but cannot with any conscience support Hillary (Clinton),\" Villarreal told NBC Latino Tuesday night. \nAlfonso Aguilar, who has been acted as spokesman for the group of Hispanics who opposed Trump and later endorsed him, said he felt disappointed and misled. — Alfonso Aguilar (@amigoaguilar) September 1, 2016 \nFor almost two weeks, some Republican Hispanics have been wading through the spin that Trump and his campaign were putting on his immigration policies. \nRELATED: Latinos Looking for 'Compassion,' Clarity in Trump Speech \nAfter meeting with him Aug. 20 at his home, some believed he had heard their concerns about the statements he'd made about immigrants and his plans to make them all leave the country. Some thought he might even offer a form of legalization. \nJacob Monty, who had been at the meeting and advising Trump on Hispanics, also told NBC Latinos that he is no longer supporting Trump.

Ted Cruz for their immigration platforms and comments. They had been backers of Jeb Bush and when he was out, tried to assist other candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., but Trump ultimately won the nomination. As loyal Republicans, they had hoped they could back Trump and were part of a group during the Republican convention that gave him their support. advertisement \nTuesday night, Trump said no one would be immune from deportation. He said he would revive two programs. One is a national fingerprinting program known as Secure Communities, in which the prints of anyone arrested against a federal database to check whether they were a citizen or an immigrant with permission to be here. He also said he'd renew the 287(g) program which used local law officers, such as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, to enforce immigration laws. \n\"We will set priorities, but unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement and Border Patrol and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) will be allowed to do their jobs, the way their jobs are supposed to be done,\" Trump said. \nIn addition, he said, anyone arrested for \"any crime whatsoever\" would be detained until they could be removed, which he said would happen immediately \"if we even have to do that.\" \nHe also said the executive actions of President Barack Obama that would shield an estimated 5 million immigrants here illegally from deportation and allow them to work. The programs are stalled in legal battles but apply to parents of U.S. citizen and legal resident children and to people who came as young children to the country. \nTrump had led some to believe even up to a few hours before the speech that he might take the advice of Hispanics who had met with him and soften his policies and speech on immigrants.
