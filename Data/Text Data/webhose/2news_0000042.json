The quartet claimed the prize over more well-known names . \nThe Nobel Committee doesn't release much information beforehand but, as a helpful guide, the unaffiliated Peace Research Institute Oslo releases its own list of potential winners. \nMajor world events — such as the European migrant crisis and the Syrian civil war — will likely once again shape the Nobel Committee's decision, said PRIO director Kristian Berg Harpviken. \n\"The challenge is to find a worthy candidate, preferably one that will also be an efficient ambassador for the prize,\" Harpviken told NBC News. \nHere are this year's likely front-runners, according to his group: Svetlana Gannushkina \nThe Russian mathematician has previously been floated as a Nobel favorite. \nAs a human rights activist, Gannushkina became a prominent voice in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict of the 1980s, in which she advocated for freeing hundreds of Azerbaijani and Armenian prisoners of war. \nLast year, she criticized the Kremlin for sowing \"mistrust\" between the Russian people and the government, as well as of foreign nongovernmental organizations operating in the country . \nGannushkina has \"a long record as an advocate for human rights, democracy and historical reconciliation in Russia and its neighborhood,\" Harpviken said, \"and a prize to her would also draw attention to the worrying political developments taking place under President Putin.\" Russian human rights activist Svetlana Gannushkina during a press conference in Moscow on Oct. 4, 2012. NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA / AFP - Getty Images Ernest Moniz and Ali Akbar Salehi \nMoniz, the U.S. energy secretary, and Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, were key players in hammering out the nuclear deal between Iran and the West. \nPresident Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani praised the agreement, and earlier this year, a historic moment occurred when international sanctions on Iran were lifted after the United Nations declared Tehran fulfilled its commitment to scale back its nuclear program. \n\"Peace agreements are always prime candidates, yet no peace treaty has been awarded the prize since 1998, when John Hume and David Trimble were rewarded for their efforts to bring peace to Northern Ireland,\" Harpviken said. \nThis fragile deal is important, he added, because it \"prevents the escalation into violence and promotes nuclear disarmament\" — a foundation for peace.
