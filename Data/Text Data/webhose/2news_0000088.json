AARON P. BERNSTEIN / Reuters Share advertisement \nPHOENIX, Arizona - Hector Barajas, an Army veteran deported to Mexico, and others like him have been working multiple political fronts to bring an end to the deportation of certain immigrant veterans, including taking their case to the 2016 presidential candidates and urging the president to take action. \nA legal U.S. resident who served more than five years in the military and was honorably discharged, Barajas runs the Deported Veterans House, also known as \"The Bunker,\" in Tijuana, Mexico, to assist other deported veterans. \nHe also is part of the coalition Honorably Discharged, Dishonorably Deported that launched in September. Made up of veterans, immigration advocates and elected officials, the coalition met with Hillary Clinton and solicited a meeting with Donald Trump to get their support for ending deportations of veterans who don't commit serious crimes. \n\"We talk a lot about honoring our veterans,\" Barajas said. \"But I feel that we should honor our veterans by taking care of them, not deporting them. No veteran should be deported.\" Play Biden Calls Out Trump Over PTSD Comments 4:04 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/778621507731\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nBarajas left the Army with an honorable discharge in 2001, but struggled to adjust to life after the military. A few months after leaving the military, he was arrested and charged with discharging a firearm from a vehicle. No one was hurt, but the crime made him deportable. Barajas pleaded guilty and after two years in jail, Barajas was deported to Mexico. \nVeterans who serve the military as green card holders, not citizens, can be deported after committing certain crimes - including some minor offenses such as possession of marijuana and some more serious crimes such as murder and rape. \nThe Honorably Discharged, Dishonorably Deported coalition has had multiple conversations with the Clinton campaign staff, which has been supportive of protecting veterans from deportation. The coalition has had one conversation with the Trump campaign, which members of the coalition say showed less interest and for the most part, was unresponsive. \nThe deportation of veterans is not specifically discussed by either candidate on their websites and the issue has not come up at the previous two debates. \nNathan Fletcher, a veteran who previously served in the California State Assembly and now chairs the coalition, said he ultimately wants the two presidential nominees to publicly take a stance. \nFletcher and others from the coalition have asked the Commission on Presidential Debates to include two questions about deported veterans in Wednesday's debate. So far, the commission and others with influence in choosing the debate questions have not said if either question will come up, but members of the coalition say there's interest in making it happen. \n\"We want the candidates to take a firm position on an issue that we believe is so important,\" Fletcher said, adding that having the candidates talk about deported veterans would help elevate the national conversation around the issue.

MANDEL NGAN / AFP - Getty Images \nRelated: Latino Lawmakers, Others Push to Stop Veterans' Deportations \nOne of the questions members of the coalition want Clinton and Trump to answer is what they would do to ensure honorably discharged veterans are not deported. \nThey also want to know what the candidates would do to ensure deported veterans receive the quality medical care they earn through their military service. \nAll who serve honorably in the U.S. military, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to treatment at Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities. But according to a July 2016 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, \"few deported veterans are granted the necessary waivers to access that care either in the states or abroad.\" \nFletcher explained that veterans who live in countries like Germany do have access to their health care benefits. \"But if you're deported to the streets of Tijuana, for example, you do not because there aren't VA facilities there.\" \nHe said the problem could be solved by having the State Department work with foreign consular offices to ensure deported veterans get medical care wherever they live. But in order for that to happen, Congress needs to pass legislation. \nThere's another route: executive action. \nMembers of the coalition want Obama to take executive action before he leaves office in January. In a meeting with White House officials last month, they called for the president to halt the deportation proceedings of veterans and pave a path for deported veterans to come back. \nThey also want the president to make permanent a discretionary program run by U.S. Customs and Immigration Service that helps green card holders serving in the military apply for citizenship. \nFletcher said often green card holders, who are legal residents, erroneously believe they automatically become citizens when they enlist in the military. When they get in trouble with the law, sometimes as a result of untreated post-traumatic stress, they are surprised when they are placed into deportation proceedings.
