of POLITICO Florida Good Tuesday morning. Hillary Clinton is scheduled to speak at USF in Tampa today, Bill Clinton fundraises tomorrow in Orlando and Gov. Rick Scott has canceled his trip to talk Zika in Washington in the aftermath of Hurricane Hermine. He’s staying close to Tallahassee, where he’s in a post-storm power struggle with Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum.\nHIGH VOLTAGE – “Scott, Gillum blow a fuse in power struggle,” by POLITICO Florida’s Bruce Ritchie: Sparks flew between Gov. Rick Scott and Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum on Monday over reconnecting power to the city’s residents in the aftermath of Hurricane Hermine. The governor’s office on Sunday said Tallahassee and Leon County had declined an offer from the Florida Department of Transportation to use work crews for downed tree removal, which Gillum denied. Soon afterwards, the governor’s office put out a press release saying that Scott's offer of assistance had been accepted.\n“Your offers of help would be so much more authentic if they also did not come at the same time as press releases were being sent out,” Gillum told Scott on Monday during a meeting at the state Emergency Operations Center. Gillum is a leading state Democrat. Scott is a Republican. http://politi.co/2cv4qe7\n-- “8 p.m.: Gov’s office release based on ‘misunderstanding’,” by Tallahassee Democrat’s William L. Hatfield: http://on.tdo.com/2cny0lj\n-- “UPDATE: The politics of power? Gillum pushes back on critics,” by Tallahassee Democrat’s William L. Hatfield: http://on.tdo.com/2c10u3r\n-- “Of politics, power and press releases,” by Tallahassee Democrat’s James Call: http://on.tdo.com/2bZohSN\nIT’S A HURRICANE, PEOPLE! – Amid the finger-pointing, let’s remember that among the many terrible realities of a hurricane striking is that power goes out. Anyone who thinks “oh, it’s just a Category 1 storm” is seriously underestimating just how destructive hurricanes are. And look at Tallahassee. For the 24 th year, in April, it was named a “Tree City USA” community. Lots of trees mean lots of branches. Lots of wind means lots of flying branches, fallen trees and downed power lines.\n** A message from Equality Florida: Did you know: The same right wing extremists block abortion access and LGBT rights in Florida?

Rick Scott’s Rough Week Also an Opportunity,” by NBC News’ Tal Axelrod: “This week was a tough one for Florida Gov. Rick Scott. Scott is helping his state navigate Zika outbreaks in parts of Miami and Miami Beach, and the initial aftermath of Hurricane Hermine which left more than 250,000 without power and caused massive flooding. Scott is also the national chairman of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's Super PAC Rebuilding America Now and the GOP candidate's overall fundraising continues to lag behind. The Florida governor also stirred mild controversy by heaping praise upon Carlos Beruff, the Trump-admiring real estate developer who lost a Senate primary challenge against incumbent and former Trump opponent Marco Rubio.” http://nbcnews.to/2cuG7No\nTIE RACE? The super PAC backing Rep. Patrick Murphy in his bid to unseat Sen. Marco Rubio has released a poll from Civis Analytics that showed the Democrat (before the Aug. 30 primary) receiving 45% support to the Republican’s 44%. No dis on Civis, but the self-ID survey has a heavy D sample (35% D; 31% R; 30% independent). And the last 9 polls have all shown Rubio leading Murphy. With those caveats in mind, some excerpts from Civis’ polling memo:\n“Murphy is tied with Rubio despite running behind Democratic benchmarks among several key groups (Democrats, non-white voters and Millennials). Murphy’s support is buoyed by running ahead of Democratic benchmarks among older, whiter, and more conservative voters. In short, Murphy has a lot of room for growth. … Rubio is running behind expectation among traditional parts of the Republican coalition in the state. We’ve seen drops in his favorability over the summer, with a 5-point decrease in favorability among Republicans over the last month. Rubio’s support is also inflated by his temporary advantage in name ID, as he is winning voters who haven’t heard of Murphy by 2-to-1.” http://politi.co/2cuUG3z\nPOLL POSITION – Just a reminder that, while Florida Playbook will feature survey snippets such as the aforementioned, POLITICO Florida generally won’t be writing standalone stories on our homepage about general election surveys from companies that robo-poll or that fail to disclose enough demographic data. We covered this more in depth two weeks ago. http://politi.co/2bzvdEO\nABORTION WARS -- “Rubio hit for opposing abortions for women with Zika,” by POLITICO’S Burgess Everett and Nick Gass : “NARAL Pro-Choice America is spending $175,000 to air a TV ad in Orlando and West Palm Beach targeting the vulnerable incumbent starting Monday, according to a source familiar with the buy. While the Republican senator has voted for every Zika funding proposal to come through the Senate, the GOP majority has failed to approve new emergency spending to combat the mosquito-born disease.” http://politi.co/2cvi3gj\nBAD COATTAILS -- “Clinton’s unfavorability rating could hurt Senate candidate Murphy,” by News-Press’ Ledyard King: http://newspr.es/2c120m0\nBUSH WHACKED -- “Rubio donors shift to Trump; Bush's, not so much,” by Tampa Bay Times’ Alex Leary: “640 Floridians who supported Rubio financially … have given to Trump since the primary … By contrast, only 113 donors to former Gov. Jeb Bush have given to Trump since Bush withdrew from presidential contention in February.” http://bit.ly/2cnuibq\nNO REPLY – “U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart wants answers from Trump,” by Naples Daily News’ Alexandra Glorioso: “U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart said he wants straight answers from his GOP presidential nominee, but Donald Trump hasn't given them. From immigration policy to policies on Cuba, Israel and Russia, Diaz-Balart said he continues to wait for Trump to offer clarification on 'a huge number of issues' that should be easy to answer. The Miami Republican laid out the issues in a detailed letter to Trump a week after the Republican convention and then again Aug. 16. 'I demand, on these issues that are very important issues to our country, to the folks that I represent.” http://bit.ly/2bOKHUI\nTRUMP U -- “Trump rejects impropriety in Trump U. donation controversy,” by POLITICO’s Cristiano Lima: Both Bondi and Trump have been the subject of complaints seeking charges on the basis of campaign contribution malfeasance after it was reported that the Florida attorney’s political committee had received the donation while deliberating a fraud case against the Republican nominee’s now-defunct real estate school. Bondi has publicly denied the reports in recent months, a response Trump echoed Monday. 'I’ve just known Pam Bondi for years. I have a lot of respect for her. Never spoke to her about that at all,' Trump said Monday, as reported by CBS’ Sopan Deb.” http://politi.co/2cizZIG\nJOLLY’S TRUMP CARD -- Republican Rep. David Jolly is doing what no other congressman in his party can: tie GOP nominee Donald Trump around the neck of his opponent. In Jolly’s case that’s former (Republican) Gov. Charlie Crist who had accepted political contributions from Trump in the past and who praised him. Here’s Jolly’s video documenting Trump and Crist’s relationship: http://bit.ly/2cvJ3t1\nTRANISTIONS -- Maria Stratienko has moved to Sen. Bill Nelson’s personal office as a scheduler. Previously, she was the special assistant for Ranking Member Nelson on the Commerce Committee, and also served tenures with Sen. Sherrod Brown and the DSCC.\nCRIST WATCH -- “Charlie Crist’s last shot at redemption,” by Heather Caygle in St. Petersburg, Florida: “Charlie Crist just can’t help himself. If there’s an election — he’s not especially picky about the race, whether it’s for governor, the Senate or the House, or the party, Republican, Democrat or independent, he’s tried them all — his name will be on the ballot. The former governor of Florida, Crist has been perpetually running for one office or another for the past 25 years. But the personal stakes of his current race for Congress, in a district where he once played quarterback for his high school football team, are higher than ever … ‘Truly, for him, this is win or go home,’ said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, a Florida operative who advised Crist in his last governor’s race but isn’t involved in this campaign.” http://politi.co/2cmPluY\nDON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK -- “Trey Radel to host SWFL radio show Daybreak again,” by Naples Daily News’ Alexandra Glorioso: “Radel, who resigned his congressional seat in the wake of a cocaine scandal, will return to the radio job he had before politics, hosting the Daybreak for Fox 92.5. ‘As I’ve grown older — maybe not always wiser, but older — and been through what I’ve been through, I don’t feel any obligation whatsoever to give out garbage political talking points … especially Republican talking points,’ Radel said.” http://bit.ly/2c84ORV\nKOCH MONEY -- “Liberal super PAC outlines Koch ties to Florida,” by POLITICO Florida’s Matt Dixon: The liberal super PAC American Bridge released a lengthy report Frida y detailing connections between the Koch Brothers, the conservative super donors, and Florida politicians, including Gov. Rick Scott and Sen. Marco Rubio. “Time and time again, the Koch brothers’ self-interested actions proved to be beneficial to their bottom line at the expense of hardworking Floridians,” reads the introduction to the report. http://politico.pro/2c4I3Nx\nNO PEARL -- “FWC: Oyster reefs ‘in worse shape’ than 2015,” by Panama City News Herald’s David Adlerstein: “On Wednesday afternoon, FWC Director Nick Wiley signed an order limiting all commercial harvesters to no more than three bags per day through May 31, 2017, and prohibiting oystering on Saturdays and Sundays. However, oystermen had been prepped for the news after an Aug. 18 meeting indicated the reduction might be necessary. A key official for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission last month told oyster industry leaders assessments have shown Apalachicola Bay’s winter oyster bars are in worse shape than they were a year ago and urged a two bag limit in the upcoming season.” http://bit.ly/2bSgRF6\nSCOURGE -- “Fentanyl being found more often in recent drug cases,” by Ocala Star Banner’s Austin L. Miller: “Florida is No. 8 on the list of the Top 10 states in the nation that have the highest numbers of confiscations of the powerful drug fentanyl. Locally, law enforcement and medical personnel are seeing more and more cases where the drug is mixed with heroin, leading to overdoses and sometimes deaths. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, illegally made fentanyl is mixed with heroin and other drugs, such as cocaine, morphine and methamphetamine.” http://bit.ly/2c7KMGQ\nSOFT ON CRIME? -- “What does Angela Corey's loss say about the changing politics of prosecution?” by Florida Times-Union’s Andrew Pantazi: “The election bid and overwhelming defeat of State Attorney Angela Corey attracted the type of national attention that would’ve seemed out of place just a few years ago. But in today’s world, voters who emphasize criminal justice reform have focused on the most powerful officials: local prosecutors. Elections across the country have cast out controversial prosecutors and replaced them. The rhetoric has largely shifted from cries of lock ’em up and throw away the key to calls for fairness and transparency. In the last three years, in places as different as Brooklyn and Shreveport, La., in Baltimore and Corpus Christi, Texas, from Chicago to St. Louis, and Orlando to Cleveland, and even in the suburbs of Phoenix, tough-on-crime prosecutors faced challengers and lost.” http://bit.ly/2bOMOYN\nCURRY’S WORLD -- “Pension tax vote ushers in the Lenny Curry era of politics,” by Florida Times-Union’s Nate Monroe: “Cue the Lenny Curry era of politics in Jacksonville. The Republican mayor of Florida’s largest city convinced an overwhelming number of voters — in a heavily Republican electorate — to approve an unprecedented sales-tax plan Tuesday that he says will solve the city’s costly pension problems once and for all. Just over a year in office, Curry now finds himself with the kind of political capital that is rare for a first-term mayor in this city. His critics are divided and few. The City Council is widely supportive, and he’s surrounded by administration officials who remain highly respected. The improving economy will continue to boost city coffers. He’s gained a few new allies and remains close with his strongest financial backers.” http://bit.ly/2cCfUR5\nBLAME OBAMACARE IN 3…2…1….? -- “State OKs 19 percent increase in health insurance,” by POLITICO Florida’s Christine Sexton : Premiums for individual health insurance policies will increase an average 19 percent next year, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation announced Friday. In most instances, the OIR approved higher premiums than the ones proposed by insurance companies that sell plans both on and off the exchange, which is where tax subsidies can be used to help offset the costs of coverage. For instance, Blue Cross and Blue Shield requested a 14.5 percent increase in rates, but was approved for a 19 percent increase. http://politi.co/2bP8ZE2\nWIZARDING WORLD -- “Armless woman accuses Universal Orlando of discrimination,” by KGUN TV’s Priscilla Casper: “An armless woman accused Universal Orlando of discriminating against her disability. Cox was born without arms. However, she can fly a plane and has a black belt in taekwondo. She said she grew up riding roller coasters at other theme parks and had no problem, but Universal Orlando was a different story.” http://bit.ly/2c6Fjzn\n-- “Disney World starts scanning kids’ fingers,” by Orlando Sentinel’s Sandra Pedicini: http://bit.ly/2bPcSb4\n-- “Family remembers boy killed by alligator at Disney World,” by AP: http://bit.ly/2cuK8Bn\nGRASSY KNOLL -- “Secret settlement of lawsuit over grass leaves few answers,” by Orlando Sentinel’s Kevin Spear: “A legal battle between an Orange County homeowner wanting to eliminate irrigation and fertilizing in her yard and a neighborhood association favoring lush lawns has ended in a secret settlement, disappointing those hoping for an environmentally favorable precedent. Renee Parker was sued by a homeowner association in 2012 for planting drought-tolerant landscaping in a neighborhood dominated by pampered lawns. Although the case was widely watched for an interpretation of state law, Parker said the court fight left her ill from stress and not able to continue. She was not available to speak in person and in emails shared photos of her yard, now covered with a new, conventional lawn. 'The house is for sale,' Parker said of her home in the Summerport community near Windermere and west of Orlando.” http://bit.ly/2bSiBhv\nHUNTER’S HEART -- “Hunter rescues deer from python's death grip in Ochopee,” by Naples Daily News’ Eric Staats: “Miami hunter Jimmy Wilson was hiking through the swampy woods near Ochopee in rural Collier County this summer when he came upon an amazing sight. A huge python, a non-native invasive species overrunning the Everglades, had wrapped itself around a white-tailed deer. Both were lying still at his feet as walked up, capturing the scene on cell phone video. In the video, Wilson keeps filming as he utters an expletive and starts firing. After the first of several shots, the snake slithers off. Wilson eventually kills it. Wilson then coaxes the deer into running off. Wilson's video doesn't show the deer jumping back to life, but movement can be heard in the brush as Wilson, breathing heavily, happily reports the outcome.” http://on.flatoday.com/2ciB9nN\nFACES OF IMMIGRATION -- “College dreams dashed by a 17-year-old immigration paperwork mistake,” by Miami Herald’s Kyra Gurney: “When Fort Lauderdale high school senior Minaldy Cadet got his acceptance letter from Boston College in March, he thought the life he had dreamed of was finally within reach. … But the family soon discovered that an immigration paperwork mistake 17 years ago could derail Cadet’s dreams and his family’s future.” http://hrld.us/2c6Goao\n-- “More than 100 exotic animals surrendered at Brevard Zoo,” by Florida Today’s Rick Neale: http://on.flatoday.com/2cuJaW5\n-- “STORIES FROM THE STREET: Shooting drones, cigarette burns and smoking crack,” by NWF Daily News’ staff : http://bit.ly/2bZnt0l\n-- “Holly Hill commissioner John Capers Jr. dies during surgery,” by The Daytona Beach News-Journal’s Matt Bruce : http://bit.ly/2bPbwgE\n-- “FBI arrests Florida man accused of threatening to kill gays,” by The New York Times’ Liam Stack: http://bit.ly/2c6GT47\n-- “Five dolphins found stranded off Islamorada in Florida Keys,” by Miami Herald’s David Goodhue: http://hrld.us/2bPcb1g\n-- “Report of a naked man on the beach leads to tragedy,” by Bradenton Herald’s Mark Young: http://bit.ly/2c11Ef6\n-- NBC 6 South Florida @nbc6: “#OnlyinFlorida: A woman seeking revenge torches a car she thought belonged to her ex” : http://on.nbc6.com/2Au3ZSI\nBATS V. ZIKA -- “Bat houses help temper Zika threat in Brevard,” by Florida Today’s Jim Waymer: “James R. Adam sees a simple, pesticide-free Zika prevention plan: bats. ‘In today’s fast-paced world of cellphones and self-importance, I thought that maybe I could reconstitute the bat house idea,’ said the Titusville resident. He’s fashioned his own bat house and wants to spread the word for others to use them. The city of Rockledge recently put bat houses on aluminum poles at Larry Schultz Park and five other parks. Bat houses have popped up countywide at parks, schools, even at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in recent years. But scientists and conservationists caution that bats are far from a cure-all for mosquito-bore illnesses, especially Zika. The types of mosquitoes that spread Zika are ‘day biters’ and bats feed at night, so seldom do the two cross paths.\n“‘The bats are probably not going to have a major impact unless that mosquito is out at dawn and dusk,’ said Shari Blissett-Clark, of Bat Belfrys, a nonprofit on Merritt Island that builds and installs bat boxes, including the recent ones in Rockledge.” http://on.flatoday.com/2cf83Y6\nCOUNTY V. GRANDMAN -- “A purple-haired grandma lives in a tree house. Now she’s told it has to come down,” by Miami Herald’s David Smiley : “Shawnee Chasser found a higher standard of living 25 years ago when she moved into a tree house. … [T]he county says the open-air chateau was built illegally, is unsafe and must be demolished in the next four months.’” http://hrld.us/2bPbl4R\n** A message from Equality Florida: LGBT and abortion rights are causes under siege from the same right-wing politicians - who have been at the center of the anti-LGBT backlash this past year, while pushing for dangerous anti-abortion legislation. As we look to the 2017 Legislative Session, we must understand that LGBT and abortion rights face a common enemy: Right wing extremists who insist their personal religious beliefs justify them in denying the rights of others. Dignity, equality, and freedom bind LGBT and abortion rights as causes in common.
