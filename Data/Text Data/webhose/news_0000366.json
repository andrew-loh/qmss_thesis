Nobody ever hears my voice. I have never gone to a rally or a protest. I don’t have time. I have worked for 35 years in the steel mills to make a life for my family – six or seven days a week. I go to church, give money to charity and do volunteer work in my community. I don’t hate anyone. I can’t figure out how or why I got to be such a deplorable guy. I hear a lot of loud voices telling me how wrong I am. I am a Christian, so that makes me a homophobe. I am pro-life, so that make me anti-women. I don’t like Obama’s policies, so that make me a racist. I believe that immigration laws should be enforced, so that makes me anti-Latino. I believe radical Islamic terrorism exists so that makes me a bigot. I am a hunter, so that makes me a radical gun nut. Well, I don’t agree with all of Trump’s positions, and I know he can’t do everything he says. But I am just wondering – can you hear me now?", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-16T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-16T00:05:41.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
