It also said law enforcement personnel and Border Patrol officers should have specific training in working with child victims of human trafficking.\n\"Children are coming in with very serious needs and have a precarious kind of existence while we sort out their future,\" said David Murphey, author of the Child Trends report. \"There's a bewildering array of agencies and offices that these children and families pass through.\"\nHowever, the government is not required to provide children publicly funded counsel because crossing the U.S. border without authorization or documentation is a civil offense and not a criminal one.\nIn recent years, the vast majority of children arriving as unauthorized migrants have been from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, fleeing rampant crime and gang violence, while the largest number of child refugees have been from Iraq, Burma, Somalia and Syria.\nThe Child Trends report was sent in advance to the U.S. State Department, which expressed its commitment to protecting child refugees. It cited the Central American Minors program, which allows parents lawfully in the U.S. to request that their children in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras be considered for refugee status â€” \"a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children have undertaken to join their parents.\"\nChild Trends, based in Bethesda, Maryland, is an independent, nonprofit organization providing research, analysis and communication to decision makers \"to improve public policies and interventions that serve children and families.\"\nBased on reporting by The Associated Press. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-07T15:14:55.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
