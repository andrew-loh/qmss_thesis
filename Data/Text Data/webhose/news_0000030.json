As recently as Monday, he told ABC News’s David Muir that it “could be” that some undocumented immigrants could stay in the country. \nAlso in the interview, Trump Jr. defended his father’s campaign policy of banning certain media organizations from covering his events. \n“There is one thing to be critical there is another thing to cover lies that are then retracted once the headline is published,” Trump Jr. said. \nWhen asked the reasoning behind the campaign’s recent decision to end the blacklist though, Trump Jr. admitted he did not know the reason. \n“I don’t know — I don’t know what the policy is. Ultimately, they’re gonna report what they’re gonna report.” Nathan McDermott is a political reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in New York.
