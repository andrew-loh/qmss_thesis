President: Trump Speech Was Fantasy, Not Policy Published September 1, 2016 \nBy William A. Stock \nPublished September 01, 2016 | FoxNews.com \nDonald Trump began his immigration speech Wednesday by promising a “detailed policy address” rather than a rally speech. It is true that he provided a bit more detail in the ten points he recited before a git crowd in Arizona than he has listed on his website since last fall but most of the additional detail came in the form of a chorus of talking points from anti-immigration hardline groups. \nHis policy proposals were a wish-list of the “enforcement only” approach that has been tried, and failed, for the past twenty years. In fact, the entire speech was a full-throated endorsement of the immigration restrictionists’ approach to the immigration debate. Trump’s vision of America is not a shining city on a hill, but a city under siege from dark forces. \nTrump’s speech provided no “pivot” to a more reasonable immigration policy, and explicitly shut down the possibility of a path to legal status for any immigrant who has overstayed a visa or has entered without authorization. It is here that the contradiction at the heart of the “enforcement only” immigration policy lies. What Mr. Trump failed to mention is that we have 11 million people living without legal status in the United States precisely because there are vanishingly few routes through which they can obtain legal status under current law, but there is significant demand from American employers for their work, and from American communities for their contributions. \nIf we are going to “enforce all of our immigration laws,” which provide no path back to legal status regardless of how good a person is or how long they have lived in the United States, then it does not matter how “fair, just and compassionate” the deportation process is. At the end of that process, with no path to legal status, families will be torn apart and American communities will be devastated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-09-01T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2016-09-01T14:42:09.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
